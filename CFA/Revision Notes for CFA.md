### MODULE 37.2 TURNOVER AND LIQUIDITY RATIOS

> [!WARNING] Remember
> To memorise all the ratios and **most importantly their implications**

1. Turnover means how quickly something is replaced or replenished, inventory turnover ratio (ITR) would be COGS / Avg. Inventory, AR turnover (ART) would be Sales / Avg. AR, AP turnover would be COGS / Avg. AP. So think intuitively, for one unit of inventory, I have ITR units of COGS, so my inventory gets replenished ITR times. 

> [!Danger] Warning
> ITR is COGS / Avg Inventory, APR is COGS / Avg. AP, ART is Sale / Avg AR. 

2. Divide any turnover ratio by 365 and you get Days of that thing. For example, Days of Inventory (DIO) = 365 / ITR, Days of AP (DPO) = 365 / APR, Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = 365 / ART
3. Current Ratio =  Current Assets / Current Liabilities. In liquidity ratios, the denominator will usually be CL. 
4. Cash Ratio =  (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities. Marketable Securities are anything that you can quickly sell and generate cash. 
5. Quick Ratio =  (Cash + Marketable Securities + AR) / Current Liabilities. 
6. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) = DSO + DIO - DPO. Assets are plus (Inventory and AR), Liability (AP) is minus. It measures how quickly inventory turns into cash. You can crank this up by aggressively demanding payments, not paying your suppliers. If it is negative then you require short term financing to cover the period. If it is positive, then you are sitting on cash that can be used in other parts of business. You can afford (CA < CL).
### MODULE 37.3 SOLVENCY AND PROFITABILITY RATIOS
1. Debt to Equity ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholder Equity. All interest bearing instruments **except leases** are part of total debt. If question is silent, treat Preference shares as Total Shareholder Equity.
2. Debt to Capital Ratio = Total Debt / (Total Debt + Total Shareholder Equity)
3. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets
4. Debt to EBITDA Ratio = Total Debt / EBITDA
5. Financial Leverage = Avg Total Assets / Avg Total Equity. *How much of shareholder equity has been used to finance the assets*
6. Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Payments **(Always EBIT, not EBITDA,  not PBT, and not PAT)**. Suppose I earn (EBIT) 100 and I have to pay 10 as interest, I can cover interest 10 times. 

> [!WARNING] Remember
> Any kind of margin is always calculated on Revenue

### MODULE 23.2 EXPENSE RECOGNITION
1. **Match costs with revenues:** recognize COGS **and estimated warranty costs** in the **period of sale**, not when paid in reality.
2. Remember US GAAP loves 'CFO'. Interest Expense go into operating always. IFRS gives you a choice. You can put Interest in 'CFF' or in 'CFO'.
3. IFRS is cool with splitting R&D. Research (incl. early software work) **expensed**; development (incl. saleable & internal software) **capitalized if criteria met**.
4. GAAP is strict, BOTH research and development is expensed. No capitalization at all.
5. GAAP hates R&D—except software. Saleable software = **capitalize (like IFRS)**; internal software = **capitalize only after build starts**.

## Equity

### MODULE 43.2: REVENUE, PROFITABILITY,AND CAPITAL

1. To calculate margin always divide by Sales. For example:
$$\text{Contribution Margin} = \frac{\text{(P - Var. Cost)} \times \text{Qty}}{\text{Revenue}}$$
> [!WARNING] Remember
> Operating Profit is **EBIT** (not EBITDA, not PAT or PBT)

2. Degree of Operating Leverage:
*By what percentage my operating profit moves with 1% change in sales*	$$ \text{DOL} = \frac{\Delta \% \text{EBIT}}{\Delta\% \text{Revenue}} $$
3. Degree of Financial Leverage
*By what percentage my net profit moves with 1% change in EBIT or operating profit*	$$ \text{DFL} = \frac{\Delta \% \text{PAT}}{\Delta\% \text{EBIT}} $$
Think in limits, suppose a firm is 0% leveraged, then $\Delta \% \text{PAT} = \Delta \% \text{EBIT}$, which implies DFL = 1 (no financial leverage). High DFL means **each borrowed buck magnifies outcomes**: more upside when EBIT rises, more pain when it falls.
4. Total Leverage = $DOL \times DFL$
$$ \text{TL} = \frac{\Delta \% \text{PAT}} {\Delta\% \text{Revenue}} $$



### MODULE 44.1: INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

1. GICS: Sector → Group → Industry → Sub-industry **[SGISub]**  
	ICB: Industry → Supersector → Sector → Subsector) **[ISSS]**  
	TRBC: Economic sector → Business sector → Group → Industry → Activity **[EBGIA]**
	*G for Group, S always for Sector, B for business, I for Industry*

2. How to classify?
	- **Single business:** classify in that business    
	- **Multiple businesses:** use the one with **≥60% revenue**    
	- **If not:** use **≥50% of revenue, profit, or assets**    
	- **If still unclear:** use **judgment** or label **conglomerate**
3. Other ways to group companies could be on the basis of business cycle (Consumer staples are stable so Defensive, Software is cyclical), geography, Financial Measures (large cap, mid cap) etc, or ESG (How green a company is?)
4. Company A sells USD 100 billion total in which Smartphones: USD 40 billion and Other products (laptops, services, TVs): USD 60 billion. Industry size = sales of the product, not total sales of multi-business firms. (only 40 bn in case of Smartphone industry)
5. Growth industries have considerable growth potential. (Semiconductors). Mature industries have little or no growth potential (Tobacco).
6. Profitability: Use ROIC (after-tax, capital-structure neutral) to rank firms by deciles, 
7. Market share = firm revenue ÷ industry size; levels are estimates, trends matter most.
8. Herfindahl Index (Industry Concentration) = sum of squared market shares; <1500 = low, 1500–2500 = moderate, >2500 = high concentration.

### MODULE 44.2: INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
1. Of the five forces described next, if some or all of them are strong, then firms will likely earn zero or close to zero economic profits (return on invested capital minus cost).
2. **Porter's Five Forces (Internal Analysis of Industry)**
	> **“Firms Fight, Entry is Expensive, Substitutes Cap Prices, Buyers Beg, Suppliers Rule.”**

	1. **Rivalry:** Rivalry is highest when many similar firms face slow growth and high fixed costs, forcing price cuts to stay at full capacity. Delta, United, American cut fares aggressively because planes, fuel contracts, and crews are fixed costs and demand grows slowly.
	2. **Barriers to Entry:** Aramco and ExxonMobil face little new competition because oil production needs billions in drilling, refining, and scale.
	3. **Threat of substitutes**: Substitutes cap pricing by making demand more price-sensitive.Pfizer can charge high prices for patented drugs.
	4. **Bargaining power of Buyers:** Buyers of addictive goods such as Cigarettes have low bargaining power.
	5. **Bargaining power of Suppliers:** Microsoft is one of the few suppliers of operating system software and thus has pricing power.
3. **PESTLE (External Analysis):**
	1. political, Trump may impose tariffs on your raw materials and you are bankrupt. Eg: Post tariff children toy industry in US. 
	2. economic, Economic cycles affect your business, an upcoming interest rate hike might wreck your leveraged business.
	3. social, This is how society reacts to a business, for example, don't try starting a beef factory in India (although its legal, but don't).
	4. technological, 
	5. legal,
	6. environmental
