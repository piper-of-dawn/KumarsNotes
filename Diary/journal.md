##### 22-06-2022: Summer Solstice
I feel like that I have stagnated. I don't feel healthy. The urge to go to gym isn't the same anymore. I am not cleaning up. I am not dressing up well. I don't feel confident. I don't feel energetic. I want to sleep.

# Habit
| When            | Where     | What                                |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Post wake up    | Outside   | Dress up and take a walk and gym    |
| Return from gym | At home   | Do housekeeping and shower (1 hour) |
| After shower    | At home   | Eat the frog (2 hour focus)         |
| At focus time   | Your wish | Dress up / Break                    |

# Execution
- Watch → Think → Note for study related stuff
- 
# Retrospective 
- Struggling to build Algorithmic trading
- Creation is stopped
- Forgot about the react native app
- Have stuck with the gym habit
- Polish learning not going well

# Remediation
- Create a daily plan
- Keep buffers / Do not try to control uncertainty
- Start from Today


# BACKLOG
- Implement Principal Component Analysis in the Code Testing Library

I need to have an ultra-learning plan:

# ULTRA-LEARNING PLAN

## Study Stack
- Spectral Analysis
- Topics in Finance
- Rust
- D3





Things have become messy. But I am trying to manage them. 
Things have gotten even more messy. 


# MISSION UNMESS
1. Module 2 is delinquent, skip it for now.
2. Start Module 3.



# HABITS

## Studying for 1 hour every day
- This is on track

## Writing for 10 minutes every day


# MEDITATIONS 
- At this stage, I think that 10 seconds of insane courage is immensely helpful.
  - You need 10 seconds of insane courage when you start something new.
- I want to build a habit of studying for 1 hour every day.
- I want to build a habit of writing for 10 minutes every day.


# THINGS I DO NOT KNOW
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Kubernetes

# Work
### Code Documentation
- I want to document the code better so that it is understandable at first sight.
- I want to complete the manual labour so that I can improve on it.

# Time Series Analysis
- I don't think I understand ACF and PACF enough to appreciate the usefulness of them.
- I still do not understand stationarity.


# Rust Time Series Library Creation

## Sprint 1: 10-03-2023 to 17-03-2023
- Complete Module 2 of un-supervised learning course
- Complete GWP 
- Code how to 
- 

## Advent of Code
### Day 23
- Find out how elves find the direction to move


# Chapter IV: Aman
Our paths crossed in the most unexpected way. I was the ambitious, driven and the sincere one - a guy with a plan who always knew where he was going (or at-least he thought he knew). Aman was the opposite. He had no plan. I saw world through the lens of objective logical reality. Aman saw the world as a continuum of subjective and abstract emotions. Trust me! Aman was like one those guys I would never want to hangout with. 

But there was something intriguing. He just lived the flow. He was this happy kid who just lived in the moment. He laughed hard and laughed with me. He carried on life with a nimble ease, even when life wasn't. We have experienced the roller-coaster of life together. The times when we had no money and the times when we had a lot of money. The times we dreamt of a life together, the time I abruptly left for another country. 
I sometimes wonder “Where does it all lead? What will become of us? Maybe it leads to each other. We become ourselves.
