1. **What is Warrant:** A warrant is essentially an equity call option issued by the company; a warrant holder has the right but not the obligation to purchase newly issued shares at the exercise price. 
2. **What is Basic EPS:** (Actual earnings - Preferred Dividend) / actual weighted ordinary shares.
3. **What are Actual weighted shares:** Weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Shares outstanding adjusted for how long they existed during the year. For example:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Shares outstanding on 1 January 2018|1,000,000|
|Shares issued on 1 April 2018|200,000|
|Shares repurchased (treasury shares) on 1 October 2018|(100,000)|
|Shares outstanding on 31 December 2018|1,100,000|
The actual weighted shares are calculated as:

|                                                                                              |           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1,000,000 × (3 months/12 months) =                                                           | 250,000   |
| 1,200,000 × (6 months/12 months) =                                                           | 600,000   |
| 1,100,000 × (3 months/12 months) =                                                           | 275,000   |
| Weighted average number of shares outstanding = (3/12) * 1 + (6/12) * 1.2 + (3/12) * 1.1<br> | 1,125,000 |

4. **What is Preferred Dividend?** This is the dividend paid to the preferred shareholders. Preferred stock doesn't come under common stock and hence EPS removes it.
5. **What is Diluted EPS:** “What EPS would be” if all dilutive instruments became common stock. This would be (Actual Earnings / (Ordinary Shares + New common stock that would have been issued at conversion))
6. **What is Dilution:** The instruments convertible into ordinary equity can become shares → share count rises → EPS goes down. That’s dilution.
7. **What is stock split:** Suppose a company with a market capitalisation of $100 has 100 shares (each share is priced $1). The company declares 2:1 stock split, which means each share would be split into 2 shares. This means the number of shares will be now: (100 * (2/1)) = 200. Now each share would be priced $0.5.




9. Complex Capital Structure: 
Under IFRS, the type of equity for which EPS is presented is referred to as ordinary. Ordinary shares are those equity shares that are subordinate to all other types of equity. 

When a company has issued any financial instruments that are potentially convertible into common stock, it is said to have a complex capital structure.
