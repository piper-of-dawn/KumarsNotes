Below is a **clean, concise, teacher-level explanation** of the entire PDF *Acquisition of Intangible Assets* in **your exact style** — dense, sharp, exam-oriented, and rooted in first principles. Citations point to the uploaded PDF pages.

# **TL;DR (First Principles)**

Intangibles = assets with **no physical form** but **future economic benefits** (patents, brands, copyrights, software, licenses).
How you account for them **depends on how they were acquired**:

1. **Purchased** → easy: cost is known, capitalize.
2. **Internally developed** → messy: IFRS splits research (expense) vs development (capitalize); US GAAP expenses almost everything.
3. **Business combination** → allocate purchase price to identifiable intangibles; excess = goodwill.

Memory hook:
**“Bought? Capitalize. Built? Probably expense. Acquired in merger? Allocate.”**

# **1. What Counts as an Intangible (Page 1)**

Intangibles must be:

* **Identifiable** (separable or arises from legal rights),
* **Under company control**,
* **Expected to generate future benefits**, and
* **Measured reliably**.
  Goodwill fails the identifiability test → appears only in business combinations, never purchased separately.

Memory hook: **“Separate, Control, Benefit, Measure.”**

---

# **2. Purchased Intangibles (Page 1)**

When you buy an intangible outside a merger (e.g., buy a patent):

* You record it at **acquisition cost**.
* If you buy a *group* of intangibles, allocate cost to each based on **fair value**.
  This is identical to how you allocate cost to multiple PPE assets.

Example: Buy three franchise rights for EUR 300,000. Fair values 50%, 30%, 20%. Allocate 150k, 90k, 60k.

Takeaway: **Purchased = no drama. Just capitalize at fair value.**

# **3. Internally Developed Intangibles (Page 1–2)**

This is where IFRS vs GAAP diverge.

### **IFRS Treatment**

IFRS splits the lifecycle into:

1. **Research phase** → expense
2. **Development phase** → capitalize **if** all six criteria are met:

   * Technical feasibility
   * Intention to complete
   * Ability to use/sell
   * Probable future benefits
   * Availability of resources
   * Reliable measurement

Memory hook: **“Research = idea; Development = product.”**

### **US GAAP Treatment**

Brutally simple:

* **Research and development are expensed**.
* Only exception: **software**

  * **Software for sale:** expense until technological feasibility → then capitalize.
  * **Software for internal use:** expense until probable use → then capitalize.

Memory hook: **“GAAP hates capitalization, except software.”**

### Impact on Financial Statements

* Capitalizing development costs inflates **assets**, **income**, and **equity**.
* Expensing makes results look conservative.

# **4. Example: Software Development Costs (Page 2)**

REH AG incurs EUR 1,090 per month.

Key point in the example:

* If recognition criteria are met **on 1 Feb**, all prior costs (Jan) are expensed; future costs (Feb onward) are capitalized.
* If criteria are met **on 1 Dec**, nearly the whole year is expensed.

Memory hook: **“Capitalization starts the day feasibility becomes real.”**

US GAAP: capitalizes the entire EUR 12,960 only when it becomes probable the internal-use software will be used as intended.

# **5. Intangibles Acquired in a Business Combination (Page 2–3)**

This is the exam core.

### **Acquisition Method (IFRS + GAAP)**

When you acquire a company:

1. Identify and fair-value **each identifiable intangible** separately (brand names, licenses, customer lists, content libraries, etc.).
2. Whatever is left over = **goodwill**.

Memory hook: **“Value the identifiable, dump the rest into goodwill.”**

### Key IFRS vs GAAP difference

* **IFRS**: an intangible is identifiable if separable OR arises from rights.
* **US GAAP**: uses similar criteria but historically slightly stricter; however, for exam purposes GAAP also separates identifiable intangibles from goodwill.

### **Big Example in PDF: AB InBev + SABMiller (Page 2–3)**

The PDF shows a real-world allocation:

* USD 193B purchase consideration
* Intangibles = USD 90.6B (mostly **brands with indefinite life**, USD ~20B)
* Goodwill = USD 74.6B
* Property, receivables, associates, cash, liabilities also allocated.

Insights from the table on page 3:

* Nearly **half** of the assets AB InBev bought were **intangible brands**.
* Goodwill came from expected synergies, workforce, purchasing power, efficiency programs, etc.
* None of goodwill is tax-deductible.

Memory hook: **“In big mergers, intangibles and goodwill dominate.”**

---

# **6. Treatment After Acquisition (Implied across pages)**

* Intangibles with **finite life** → amortize.
* **Indefinite-life** intangibles → no amortization; test for impairment annually.
* Goodwill → impairment only; **never amortized**, **never reversed**.

Memory hook: **“Finite fades; Infinite tested; Goodwill only goes down.”**

---

# **7. Why This Matters for Analysts**

* Different accounting (capitalize vs expense) distorts **margins**, **ROA**, **ROE**, **cash flows**, **EV/EBITDA**, etc.
* Purchased intangibles vs internally developed intangibles lead to **comparability problems** across firms.
* In mergers, large goodwill can signal **overpayment** or **expected synergies**.

---

# **Exam-Ready Revision Sheet (Your Style)**

* Intangibles = identifiable, controlled, future benefits, measurable.
* Purchased → capitalize at cost / fair value.
* Internally developed:

  * IFRS: Research = expense; Development = capitalize if criteria met.
  * GAAP: Expense everything except software under special rules.
* Business combination:

  * Identify and value each intangible separately; rest = goodwill.
* Finite intangibles = amortize; indefinite = impairment only.
* Goodwill = impairment only, never reversed.
* Software (IFRS): capitalize after feasibility; (GAAP): capitalize after feasibility/probable use.
* Major example: AB InBev allocation → vast intangibles + goodwill.
