> IFRS lets interest and dividends sit in operating, investing, or financing, so CFO can be inflated or deflated depending on classification. Before using any cash-flow ratio, rebuild CFO consistently by re-placing these items where they belong.

## TL;DR (casual, first-principles)

These ratios tell you **how much real cash** the business produces compared to revenue, assets, equity, or obligations. Think of CFO as *pure cash muscle*. These ratios measure how strong that muscle is and whether it can carry debt, reinvest, or pay dividends. IFRS sometimes messes this up because interest/dividends can sit in different sections, so you must adjust CFO correctly.

# **Cash Flow Ratios — Exam-Ready Notes (Your Style)**

Concise. High-yield. With memory hooks.

---

## **Memory Hooks (use these before the formulas)**

* **“CFO is king.”** Every ratio here answers: *Can CFO fund this item?*
* **“Revenue → Assets → Equity → Obligations → Growth.”** The ratios follow this natural chain.
* **IFRS trap:** Interest/dividends may be in *operating* or *financing*. Fix CFO before plugging into ratios.

---

# **1. PERFORMANCE RATIOS**

These measure *cash productivity* of operations.

### **1. Cash Flow to Revenue**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Net Revenue

**Interpretation:**
How many cash rupees/dollars the firm actually collects per revenue rupee/dollar.
**Hook:** *“High sales, but no cash? Red flag.”*

---

### **2. Cash Return on Assets (CROA)**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Avg Total Assets

**Interpretation:**
Cash yield on the firm’s asset base.
**Hook:** *“Are our assets cash-efficient or just decoration?”*

---

### **3. Cash Return on Equity (CROE)**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Avg Equity

**Interpretation:**
Cash returned on owners’ capital.
**Hook:** *“How hard is equity working in cash terms?”*

---

### **4. Cash to Income**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Operating Income (EBIT)

**Interpretation:**
How well earnings convert to cash.
**Hook:** *“Is EBIT fake or real?”*

---

### **5. Cash Flow per Share**

**Formula:**
(CFO – Preferred Dividends) ÷ Weighted Avg Common Shares

**Interpretation:**
Cash available per share (more reliable than EPS).
**Exam IFRS Trap:**
Under IFRS, if total dividends are in CFO (operating), add them back first, then subtract preferred dividends.

---

# **2. COVERAGE RATIOS**

These measure **ability to meet obligations** using CFO.

---

### **6. Debt Coverage**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Total Debt

**Interpretation:**
How well cash covers total debt.
**Hook:** *“How many years of CFO to wipe all debt?”*

---

### **7. Interest Coverage (Cash-Based)**

**Formula (US GAAP):**
(CFO + Interest Paid + Taxes Paid) ÷ Interest Paid

**Interpretation:**
Can operations fund interest obligations?
**IFRS Trap:**
If interest paid is classified under financing, **do NOT add it back**.

**Hook:**
*“Does CFO carry interest on its back, or does it collapse?”*

---

### **8. Reinvestment Ratio**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Cash Paid for Long-Term Assets (CapEx)

**Interpretation:**
Ability to fund growth internally.
**Hook:** *“Can we buy new machines without borrowing?”*

---

### **9. Debt Payment Ratio**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Cash Paid for Long-Term Debt Repayment

**Interpretation:**
Capacity to retire principal using cash from operations.
**Hook:** *“CFO vs loan principal—who wins?”*

---

### **10. Dividend Payment Ratio**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Dividends Paid

**Interpretation:**
Are dividends sustainably funded by cash?
**Hook:** *“Is the dividend real or borrowed?”*

---

### **11. Investing + Financing Coverage**

**Formula:**
CFO ÷ Cash Outflows for Investing + Financing Activities

**Interpretation:**
Global measure: Can CFO cover overall strategic outflows—CapEx, debt repayment, distributions?
**Hook:** *“One ratio to judge all obligations.”*

---

# **IFRS ADJUSTMENTS (Critical Exam Area)**

### **A. Interest Paid / Received**

Under IFRS:

* Interest paid → **Operating** or **Financing**
* Interest received → **Operating** or **Investing**
* Dividends received → **Operating** or **Investing**
* Dividends paid → **Financing** (but can appear in operating depending on company policy)

**Implication:**
CFO under IFRS is not standardized.
**Always reconstruct CFO for comparability before plugging into ratios.**

---

# **Memorable Example (IFRS Trap)**

Company A (IFRS) puts **interest paid in financing**.
Company B (US GAAP) puts **interest paid in operating**.

If you naïvely compute Interest Coverage:

* A looks stronger because CFO is artificially higher.
* B looks weaker because CFO is net of interest.

**Memory hook:**
*“IFRS can hide interest in financing. Restore CFO before analysis.”*
