## Gordon Growth Model
In much of the finance literature, you will see this model referred to as the constant growth DDM, infinite period DDM, or the Gordon growth model. Whatever you call it, memorize D1 over (k minus g). Note that our valuation model for preferred stock is the same as the constant growth model with no growth (g = 0)

## Operating Cycle
The operating cycle is the total time from when a company receives inventory from suppliers to when it collects cash from customers. The formula is: Operating Cycle = Days of Inventory on Hand + Days Sales Outstanding. From the data: Operating Cycle = 30 + 40 = 70 days. The mechanism: inventory is received at day 0, held for 30 days, then sold to customers who pay 40 days later (at day 70 from the initial purchase). The operating cycle is different from the cash conversion cycle, which also accounts for the time a company takes to pay suppliers (DPO). The CCC is shorter than the OC by the amount of DPO. Edge case: a company with a 70-day operating cycle needs financing for that entire period unless customers prepay or it maintains significant cash reserves.
