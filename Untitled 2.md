>[!QUESTION] Question
> A company with revenues of $1,000 and operating expenses of $800 needs to invest $1,000 in assets. The assets can be 100% equity or a mix of 50/50 debt and equity. The interest rate on debt is 10% (assume no taxes). Calculate the ROE under both financing scenarios.

ROE = Profit After Tax / Equity

**Scenario 1**
Equity = $1000
PAT = $200
ROE = 20%

**Scenario 2**
Equity = $500
Debt = $500
Interest = $50
PAT = $150
ROE = 30%

As can be seen in the previous example, increasing leverage (and therefore, risk) can increase the return on equity as long as the expected rate of return on assets exceeds the cost of debt.

> Continuing the previous example, calculate the company’s ROE if its revenues decrease by 15%, assuming no change in cash operating expenses.

ROE = Profit After Tax / Equity

**Scenario 1**
OC = $800
Revenue = $850
PAT = $50
Equity = $1000
ROE = 5%

**Scenario 2**
Revenue = $850
OC = $800
EBITDA = $50
Interest = $50
PAT = 0
Debt = $500
Equity = $500
ROE = 0%

1. Under shareholder theory, the primary focus of corporate governance is the interests of the firm’s shareholders, which is to maximise the market value of the firm’s common equity. Under this theory, corporate governance is primarily concerned with the conflict of interest between the firm’s managers and its owners (shareholders).
2. The focus of corporate governance under stakeholder theory is broader. It considers conflicts among several groups that have an interest in the activities and performance of the firm.
3. Private debt holders may have access to nonpublic information from company management, which decreases information asymmetry. 
4. The board of directors is responsible for protecting the interests of shareholders; hiring, firing, and setting the compensation of the firm’s senior managers; establishing the strategic direction of the firm; and monitoring the company’s financial performance and other aspects of its ongoing activities.
5. In a one-tier board structure, both inside and independent directors serve on a single board.
6. Indra Nooyi - Independent Director at Amazon. No executive role. Provides external judgement on strategy and governance. Jeff Bezos - Founder and Inside Director at Amazon. Built the firm. Deep operational control and influence.
7. In continental Europe, boards have a two-tier structure in which the independent directors serve on a supervisory board that oversees a management board comprising inside directors.
8. Minority shareholders prefer independent directors, as they would act in the best interests of the shareholders as opposed to acting in the interests of the management. 
9. Full board election would allow the shareholders to vote out the board if it was ineffective.
10. In a staggered board, only a fraction of the board is elected each year. This decreases the power of shareholders to enact a major overhaul of the board. 

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE:CONFLICTS, MECHANISMS, RISKS, AND BENEFITS

1. Managers and directors may choose a lower level of business risk than shareholders would. Managers have their employment income tied to the firm and stand to lose it, should the firm fail. Shareholders can diversify their portfolios cheaply, and as such might prefer that individual companies take more risk. 
2. Some firms have a dual-class structure with different classes of common stock outstanding, some with more voting power than others. This can give a group of shareholders (e.g., the company’s founders) effective control of the company even if they have claims to less than 50% of its earnings and assets. 
3. **CFA Institute advocates against dual-class** voting structures because they allow one group of shareholders to further their interests at the expense of other groups. 
4. Ordinary resolutions, such as the approval of an auditor and the election of directors, require a simple majority of the votes cast. 
5. Other resolutions are addressed at extraordinary general meetings, which can be called any time a matter requires a shareholder vote. Examples include amendments to the company’s bylaws, a merger or takeover, a shareholder-proposed special board election, or the liquidation of the firm.
6. Activist shareholders pressure companies in which they hold a significant number of shares for changes they believe will increase shareholder value. They may initiate shareholder lawsuits or seek representation on the board of directors. Hedge funds have engaged increasingly in shareholder activism at firms in which they hold significant stakes. *Elon Musk started as an activist large shareholder to reform twitter before buying it*
7. A shareholder activist group may initiate a proxy contest, in which they seek the proxies of shareholders to vote in favor of their alternative proposals, or may make a tender offer for enough shares of a company to gain control. Both senior managers and boards of directors can be replaced by shareholders when they believe company performance is poor and would be improved by change. 
8. The threat of a hostile takeover, one not supported by the company’s management, can act as an incentive for company managements and boards to pursue policies better aligned with the interests of shareholders.
9. On the other hand, it might also cause the current management or board to adopt takeover defenses such as staggered board elections or poison pill provisions (low-price additional share offerings to current shareholders).

- If you dont pay within b days, make sure you pay c 

$$ EAR = \left(1+\frac{a}{1-a}\right)^{365/(c-b)} - 1 $$

capital is current assets less current liabilities. Analysts often prefer to measure net
working capital, using only operating current assets and operating current liabilities,

Operating CA = CA - Cash+Marketable Secs
Operating CA = CL - Short Term Loans

liquidity. A drag on liquidity occurs when cash inflows lag. This can occur
when excess inventory builds up or inventory becomes obsolete (DOH increases), or
when collections are slow or receivables become uncollectible (DSO increases). A pull
on liquidity occurs when cash outflows accelerate

- Quick Ratio excludes inventory and prepaid accounts from current assets
- Quick Ratio = (Cash+Secs+AR)/CL
