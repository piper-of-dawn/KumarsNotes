# **Improved Notes: Asset Measurement and Research–Development Treatment (No Abbreviations)**

---

> [!TLDR] TL;DR
> 1. Revaluation is allowed only under international (IFRS) standards; United States (US GAAP) standards prohibit it.
> 2. Research is always expensed under both standards.
> 3. Development can be capitalised only under IFRS standards and only when six strict conditions are met.
> 4. United States standards expense both research and development (except after technological feasibility for software).
> 5. Anything that does not add future economic benefit must be expensed.

# **1. Measurement of Long-Lived Assets**

## **A. Cost Model (Allowed Under Both International Standards and United States Standards)**

* The asset is recorded at **its original purchase cost**, minus **accumulated depreciation** and **any impairment losses**.
* This is the **default and required model** under United States accounting standards.
* International standards allow the cost model but do not require it.
* 
Think of buying a **car for your business**:
- You bought the car for **₹10,00,000** → this is your **original purchase cost**.    
- Each year, the car **loses value due to use**; suppose depreciation totals **₹3,00,000** after a few years.    
- One year, the car meets a minor accident and permanently loses **₹50,000** of value → this is an **impairment loss**. 

Under the **cost model**, the value reported on the balance sheet is:
**₹10,00,000 (original cost)  
– ₹3,00,000 (depreciation)  
– ₹50,000 (impairment)**  
= **₹6,50,000 carrying value**

Now the rules:
- **United States standards**:  
    You **must** keep reporting the car this way. No revaluing it to fair market value.    
- **International standards**:  
    You **may** continue using the cost model _or_ choose the revaluation model.  
    So if the market value of similar cars suddenly rises, you are allowed to revalue it upward (but only under international rules).---

## **B. Revaluation Model (Allowed Only Under IFRS Standards)**

* Asset is periodically re-measured at fair value.
* After revaluation, the carrying value becomes fair value minus later depreciation.
* **Revaluation increases go to the statement of other comprehensive income (called revaluation surplus).**
* **Revaluation decreases go to the income statement, unless reversing a past surplus.**

> [!TIP] **Important Point**
> * **United States (US GAAP) accounting standards prohibit all revaluations.**
> * Under United States standards, Property, Plant, and Equipment must remain on the **cost model** only.

# **2. Research and Development Treatment**

## **A. Under International Standards (IFRS)**

### **Research Phase**
* **Always expensed.**
  Reason: Too much uncertainty. No clearly identifiable future economic benefit at this stage.
### **Development Phase**

Costs are **capitalised only if every one of the following six conditions is satisfied**:

1. The project is technically feasible.
2. The company intends to complete the asset.
3. The company has the ability to use or sell the asset.
4. The asset will generate future economic benefits.
5. Adequate technical and financial resources are available to complete the project.
6. The cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

**If even one of these conditions fails → expense the entire amount.**

### **Examples of development costs that can be capitalised**
* Direct materials used in development
* Direct labour
* Testing and prototype costs
* Engineering and design costs directly related to the asset

### **Costs that must always be expensed (cannot be capitalised)**
* Administrative overhead
* General overhead
* Training costs
* Wasted materials
* Inefficiencies
* Advertising or promotional activities

---

## **B. Under United States Accounting Standards (US GAAP)**

### **General Rule**
* **Both research costs and development costs are expensed immediately.**
  This is the key distinction from international standards.

### **Exception: Software Development Costs**
Under United States rules for internal-use software or software for sale:
* **Before technological feasibility** → expense
* **After technological feasibility** → capitalize
* **Costs to maintain, debug, or fix issues** → expense
This is a very common examination trap.

---

# **3. General Capitalisation Rule (Applies Under Both Standards)**

> **Only capitalise costs that clearly add future economic benefit to the asset.
> Costs that do not add future benefit must be expensed.**

### **Examples of costs that never create future benefit**

* General administrative overhead
* Selling and marketing expenses
* Staff training
* Startup losses
* Research phase expenses
* Repair costs that only maintain, not improve, the asset
