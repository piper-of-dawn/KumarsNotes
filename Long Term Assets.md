# 1. What Are Long-Lived Assets?

Long-lived assets are resources a company uses to generate value for **many years**, not just one period.  
They include:

- **Tangible** assets (Property, Plant & Equipment — PPE)  
- **Intangible** assets (patents, brands, software, licenses)  

### Economic View vs Accounting View
- **Economic view**: Everything that creates long-term value *counts*, including reputation, trained workforce, brand equity.
- **Accounting view**: Only items that meet strict *recognition criteria* appear on the balance sheet.

**Why the difference?**  
Accounting prioritizes *verifiability*, not economic poetry.  
We cannot measure “company culture” reliably, so it does not appear as an asset.

**Memory hook:**  
*Economics sees everything; accounting only records what it can prove.*

# 2. Recognition: When Does a Cost Become an Asset?

To be recorded as an intangible asset under IFRS, it must be:
1.	Identifiable – The asset must be distinct, separable (able to be sold or transferred), or arise from legal rights like patents or licenses.
2.	Controlled – The company must have power over the asset to obtain benefits and restrict others’ use.
3.	Expected to bring future economic benefits – The asset should generate revenue or cost savings.
4.	Cost measurable reliably – The amount paid or incurred must be measurable with reasonable certainty.

If ANY of these fail, the cost must be expensed.

This separation explains why:
- Trained workforce = **not** an asset  
- Patent = **asset**  
- Goodwill = only recognized in M&A (because not identifiable)

**Memory hook:**  
*Separate – Control – Benefit – Measure.*

---

# 3. Purchased Intangibles  
(Ex: Buying a patent, a trademark, a customer list)

Purchased intangibles are the **easiest** category.

### How they’re recorded:
- Capitalize at **cost** (purchase price + legal fees)
- If buying a **bundle** of rights → allocate cost based on **relative fair value**

**Why fair value allocation?**  
Because it shows exactly which rights the company considered valuable.

---

# 4. Internally Developed Intangibles  
(Where companies get confused — and exams focus heavily)

## IFRS Treatment
IFRS splits internal development into two phases:

### **Research Phase → Expense**
Because:
- Outcome uncertain  
- No reliable expectation of future benefits  
- Cannot justify calling it an asset  

### **Development Phase → Capitalize (if ALL criteria met)**  
Once feasibility is demonstrated, you can argue:
- “This will generate future cash”  
- “We know what we are building”  
- “We can measure costs reliably”

**Criteria to capitalize development:**
- Technical feasibility  
- Intention to complete  
- Ability to use/sell  
- Probable economic benefits  
- Resources available  
- Reliable measurement of costs  

**Memory hook:**  
*Research = curiosity; Development = commitment.*

## GAAP Treatment
US GAAP is much stricter:
- **Expense both research and development**  
- Only exception: **software**  
  - For sale → capitalize after *technological feasibility*  
  - For internal use → capitalize after *probable use*

**Memory hook:**  
*GAAP hates intangibles—unless it’s software.*

---

# 5. Software Development Example  
To illustrate recognition timing:

REH AG spends EUR 1,090 per month.

### Under IFRS:
- Feasibility reached in **Feb** → Jan expensed, Feb–Dec capitalized  
- Feasibility reached in **Dec** → almost entire year expensed  

### Under GAAP:
Once “probable use” is reached, **all further development costs** are capitalized.

**Conceptual insight:**  
The *timing* of recognition determines how much becomes an asset.

# 6. Intangibles Acquired in a Business Combination (M&A)

This is the **big one**.

When a company buys another company, accounting uses the **acquisition method**:

### Step 1 — Identify intangible assets separately  
Must be:
- Separable OR  
- Based on legal rights  

Examples:
- Brands  
- Licenses  
- Customer lists  
- Internet domain names  
- Technology / software  
- Publishing rights  
- Franchises  

### Step 2 — Assign fair value  
Determine what each item is worth *as if* purchased alone.

### Step 3 — Goodwill = leftover  
Goodwill captures value that:
- Cannot be separated  
- Cannot be sold independently  
- Represents synergy, workforce, future benefits  

**Memory hook:**  
*Identify → value → leftover = goodwill.*

# 7. Case Study: AB InBev + SABMiller

A real example showing how huge intangibles can get.

### Key numbers:
- Total purchase: **$193B**  
- Identifiable intangibles: **$90.6B**  
- Goodwill: **$74.6B**  
- PPE: $9.6B  
- Brands with indefinite lives: $19.9B  

**Lesson:**  
Big acquisitions heavily reflect **intangible assets and goodwill**, not factories and trucks.

**Memory hook:**  
*In big M&A, intangible assets + goodwill = the real purchase.*

---

# 8. Depreciation & Amortization

## Tangible PPE → Depreciation  
Spreads cost over estimated useful life.

## Finite-life intangibles → Amortization  
Patents, customer lists, licenses with fixed terms.

## Indefinite-life intangibles → No amortization  
Brands, trademarks without expiry.

**Why?**  
If an asset can last indefinitely, you cannot assign a useful life.

**Memory hook:**  
*Finite = Fade; Indefinite = Intact.*

---

# 9. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Impairment = unexpected decline in recoverable value below carrying value.

## IFRS Impairment Model
Recoverable amount = **higher of:**
- Value-in-use (discounted cash flows)  
- Fair value less costs to sell  

IFRS allows **reversals** (except goodwill).

## GAAP Impairment Model
Two steps:
1. Compare carrying amount with **undiscounted** cash flows  
2. If impaired → write down to fair value  

No reversals allowed.

**Memory hook:**  
*IFRS forgives; GAAP remembers.*

---

# 10. Revaluation Model (IFRS Only)

IFRS allows:
- **Cost model**  
- **Revaluation model** (fair value updates)

GAAP allows only:
- **Cost model**

**First principles:**  
Revaluation better reflects economic reality but introduces volatility and subjectivity.

**Memory hook:**  
*IFRS = Two roads; GAAP = One-way street.*

---

# 11. Derecognition & Disposal  
When selling PPE/intangibles:

**Gain/Loss = Sale proceeds – Carrying value**

- Previous impairments affect carrying amount  
- Under IFRS, previous reversals also change carrying amount  
- Interpreting gain/loss requires understanding asset history  

**Memory hook:**  
*Cash minus book = real gain.*

---

# 12. Presentation & Disclosure (IFRS Focus)

IFRS requires extensive disclosures for PPE & intangibles:

### Companies must disclose:
- Measurement model (cost or revaluation)  
- Depreciation methods & useful lives  
- Opening & closing carrying amounts  
- Additions / disposals / reclassifications  
- Impairment losses & reversals  
- Restrictions, pledges, contractual commitments  

### Why so detailed?
Because the **entire lifecycle** of a long-lived asset affects:
- Profitability  
- Cash flow  
- Future reinvestment needs  
- Risk assessment  

---

# 13. Using Disclosures in Analysis

Disclosures help analysts compute:

## Fixed Asset Turnover  
= Revenue ÷ Average Net PPE  
Measures efficiency.

## Asset Age  
= Accumulated Depreciation ÷ Annual Depreciation  

## Total Useful Life  
= Historical Cost ÷ Annual Depreciation  

## Remaining Life  
= Net PPE ÷ Annual Depreciation  

## Reinvestment Rate  
= Capex ÷ Depreciation  

If >1 → company is expanding or renewing PPE faster than depreciation.

**Memory hook:**  
*Turnover–Age–Reinvestment (TAR framework).*

# 14. Why All of This Matters for CFA Exams

Because long-lived asset rules affect:
- Profitability (development capitalization vs expensing)  
- Balance sheet strength  
- ROA, ROE  
- Impairment risk  
- Comparability across firms  
- M&A valuation  
- Cash flow patterns  
- Disclosure interpretation in real annual reports  

These topics appear in:
- FSA  
- Corporate Finance  
- Equity Valuation  
- FRA calculations  
- MCQs involving IFRS vs GAAP differences

# Final Ultra-Condensed Memory Hooks
- **IFRS: R expensed, D capitalized; GAAP: expense both**  
- **IFRS allows revaluation; GAAP doesn’t**  
- **IFRS allows impairment reversal (not goodwill); GAAP never**  
- **Finite intangibles = amortize; Indefinite = no amortization**  
- **M&A = fair value identification + goodwill**  
- **Impairment = carrying vs recoverable**  
- **Capex > Dep = reinvestment**  
- **Turnover = revenue productivity**
