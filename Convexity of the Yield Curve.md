### What is a convex function?
If $f(x)$ is twice differentiable then $f´´(x) > 0$. 

### What does it mean?
In terms of rate of change, convexity means rate of change itself is increasing that is acceleration is positive. 

### Convexity of the Yield Curve
Suppose we have a 1-period zero coupon bond.
$$ P  = FV (1+r)^{-t} $$
$$ \frac{dP}{dr} = -t(1+r)^{-t-1}\cdot FV < 0 $$
$$ \frac{d²P}{dr²} = t(t+1)(1+r)^{-t-2}\cdot FV > 0 $$
We see that the first derivative is negative and the second derivative is positive. Therefore, the function decreases as at a decreasing rate. The positive second derivative implies that slope is approaching towards zero so the function is decelerating. 

### What does this mean intuitively?
At the higher levels of yield, a small decline  in yield causes a larger increase in bond price - however at lower yields, the same decline will cause a small increase. 

### What is its implication?
In a high yield environment, long duration bonds like TLT will gain sharply as yields falls.  


### Question
A non-callable, fixed-coupon bond has a price of 106.0625 and a YTM of 2.8%. If the YTM were to increase instantaneously by 80 bps, the price of the bond would decrease by 11%. If the YTM were to decrease instantaneously by 80 bps, the price of the bond would increase by:
