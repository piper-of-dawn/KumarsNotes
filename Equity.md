[]()# **TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Reading 26.01 Introduction)**
## TLDR (first-principles)

A financial system exists because *money, information, risk, and timing* don’t naturally line up across people.
Analysts exist to **bridge these mismatches** by gathering information and deciding *what to buy/sell*, *when*, and *at what price*.
This reading tells you:

1. **What the financial system does**,
2. **What instruments trade**,
3. **Who the intermediaries are**,
4. **How trades happen**, and
5. **What makes markets well-functioning & regulated**.

---

## 1. The Role of the Financial Analyst

**Core idea:** Analysts convert raw information → decisions → trade execution.

Examples:

* **Fixed income analyst:** Evaluates credit + macro to choose bonds.
* **Equity analyst:** Values companies to pick stocks.
* **Corporate treasurer:** Manages FX/IR risks.
* **Risk manager:** Uses futures/options to hedge commodity or market exposures.

**Memorable hook:** *An analyst is a translator: they translate “economic noise” into “actionable trades.”*

---

## 2. Why Analysts Must Know Markets

Analysts aren’t just valuing assets; they must understand **where** their decisions get executed.
Market structure influences:

* transaction cost
* liquidity
* execution speed
* slippage
* financing risk
* leverage cost (for short/long positions)

**First principle:** A good idea poorly executed = a bad idea.

---

## 3. Reading Structure (What CFA Wants You to Know)

### **Section 2 — Functions of a Financial System**

Think: *What does a financial system give society?*

* Moves capital from savers → users
* Helps parties share risk
* Provides information (prices signal value)
* Facilitates exchange across time (borrowing/lending)
* Supports trading, hedging, and diversification

### **Section 3 — Assets & Markets**

CFA divides assets roughly into:

* **Securities** (equity, debt)
* **Currencies**
* **Contracts** (derivatives: futures, swaps, options)
* **Commodities**
* **Real assets** (real estate, infrastructure)

Analysts need to know:

* payoff structure
* liquidity
* pricing conventions
* risks
* how each is traded

**Reason:** Different objectives → different instruments.

### **Section 4 — Financial Intermediaries**

They reduce frictions.
Examples:

* Broker-dealers
* Exchanges
* Clearing houses
* Banks
* Asset managers
* Insurance companies
* Custodians

**Analogy:** They are “plumbing” that keeps capital flowing.

### **Section 5 — Trading Positions**

Two positions only:

* **Long:** benefit if price rises
* **Short:** benefit if price falls

Must understand:

* leverage
* margin
* financing cost
* risk asymmetry
* how funding affects return

### **Section 6 — How Orders Work**

Covers:

* order types (market, limit, stop, etc.)
* order handling
* quotes, bid-ask, depth
* how trades get matched
* execution priority rules

**Why it matters:** Wrong order type = unwanted fill.

### **Section 7 — Primary Markets**

Where new securities are issued.
Key:

* IPOs
* seasoned offerings
* private placements
* underwriting

### **Section 8 — Secondary Markets**

Where existing securities trade.
Focus:

* dealer markets
* auction markets
* electronic markets
* hybrid markets

Analysts care because liquidity determines real execution cost.

### **Sections 9 & 10 — Market Quality + Regulation**

A good market is:

* liquid
* transparent
* fair
* orderly
* with low transaction cost

Regulation improves:

* investor protection
* systemic stability
* market integrity

---

## Memory Hooks

Use these short associations during revision:

1. **Analyst = Translator** (info → trades)
2. **Markets = Plumbing** (infrastructure enabling capital flow)
3. **Assets = Tools** (each has a specific job)
4. **Positions = Views** (long = bullish, short = bearish)
5. **Orders = Instructions** (precision determines outcome)
6. **Primary = Birth, Secondary = Life** (of securities)
7. **Regulation = Seatbelt** (prevents crashes but slows nobody meaningfully)

---

## Ultra-Condensed Exam Notes

* Financial analysts evaluate information and execute decisions across multiple assets.
* Must understand market mechanics to control execution cost and risk.
* Reading covers: (1) financial system roles, (2) asset types, (3) intermediaries, (4) positions, (5) order processing, (6) primary vs secondary markets, (7) market quality & regulation.
* Key skill: Map financial objectives → correct asset → correct market → correct execution method.


**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.03: Assets and Contracts)**

# TLDR (first-principles)

All assets are just **containers for payoffs** and all markets are **places where those containers are exchanged**.
The entire classification exists so analysts can:

* know what something *is* (equity? debt? derivative? commodity?)
* know *where* it trades (spot? forward? primary? secondary?)
* know *how* liquid, risky, or regulated it is.

If you can map “asset → market → purpose,” you understand this reading.

---

# 1. Big Picture

You deal with **5 asset classes** and **2 big families**:

### **Financial assets**

(securities, currencies, contracts)

### **Physical assets**

(commodities, real assets)

People use them to:

* raise money
* invest
* hedge risk
* speculate
* move cash across forms/currencies

**Memory hook:**
*Financial = paper claims.*
*Physical = stuff you can touch.*

---

# 2. Asset Classifications

## 2.1 Financial Assets

### **A. Securities**

1. **Debt (fixed-income)** → promise to repay
2. **Equity** → ownership
3. **Pooled vehicles** → ETFs, mutual funds, REITs, MLPs

**Key rule:**
ETFs holding only stocks are generally counted as equities.

### **B. Currencies**

Money issued by national authorities.

### **C. Contracts (Derivatives)**

Values depend on an underlying.
Types:

* Forward
* Futures
* Swaps
* Options
* Insurance contracts

**Two subtypes:**

* **Physical derivative** → underlying is physical (oil, gold)
* **Financial derivative** → underlying is equity/bond/index

---

# 3. Physical Assets

### **A. Commodities**

Precious metals, energy, industrial metals, agricultural goods.

### **B. Real Assets**

Real estate, aircraft, machinery, infrastructure.

---

# 4. Securities: Public vs Private

### **Public securities**

* Registered
* Traded on exchanges or via dealers
* High disclosure, corporate governance standards
* Usually liquid

### **Private securities**

* Not publicly listed
* Limited to qualified investors
* Illiquid
* Venture capital = early-stage private equity

**Memory hook:**
*Public = transparent + tradable.*
*Private = opaque + illiquid.*

---

# 5. Market Classifications

## 5.1 By *timing of delivery*

| Market Type         | Meaning                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Spot (cash)**     | Immediate delivery                    |
| **Forward/Futures** | Delivery in the future                |
| **Options**         | Future delivery **if holder chooses** |

---

## 5.2 By *who receives money*

| Market               | What happens                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Primary market**   | Issuer sells → issuer receives funds |
| **Secondary market** | Investors trade with each other      |

**Memory hook:**
*Primary = birth of the security.*
*Secondary = life of the security.*

---

## 5.3 By *maturity*

| Market             | Instruments                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Money market**   | ≤ 1 year (CP, CD, T-bills, repos) |
| **Capital market** | > 1 year (bonds, equities)        |

---

## 5.4 By *investment type*

| Market                      | Consists of                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traditional investments** | Public equities + public debt + public pooled funds                         |
| **Alternative investments** | Hedge funds, private equity, real estate, commodities, leases, collectibles |

Why alternatives trade at discounts:

* hard to value
* illiquid
* need specialist research

**Memory hook:**
*Traditional = liquid + regulated.*
*Alternatives = illiquid + opaque + specialist.*

---

# 6. Example Breakdown (CFA Example 5)

**Q:** Fund can invest only in **public equities in secondary markets**. Can it buy…?

| Asset                               | Allowed? | Why                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 1. Public stock on exchange         | Yes      | Public + equity + secondary |
| 2. Public stock traded via dealers  | Yes      | Dealer = secondary market   |
| 3. Government bond                  | No       | Public but **not equity**   |
| 4. Single-stock future              | No       | Derivative, not equity      |
| 5. Shares sold first time by issuer | No       | **Primary** market          |
| 6. Shares in private bank           | No       | Private equity              |

**Pattern to remember:**
*"Public equity" requires: public registration + equity nature + not primary.*

---

# 7. Compact Revision Notes (memorize these)

### **Assets**

* Financial = securities + currencies + contracts
* Physical = commodities + real assets
* Securities = debt + equity + pooled vehicles
* Derivatives = value from underlying

### **Markets**

* Spot vs forward/futures vs options
* Primary vs secondary
* Money (≤1 yr) vs capital (>1 yr)
* Traditional vs alternative

### **Public vs Private**

* Public = registered, high disclosure, liquid
* Private = limited access, illiquid, VC/PE

### **Purpose**

* raise funds
* invest
* hedge
* speculate
* convert currency/form

---

# 8. Memory Hooks (use for retention)

* **“Paper vs Physical”** → financial vs real
* **“Birth vs Life”** → primary vs secondary
* **“Now vs Later”** → spot vs forward
* **“Short vs Long Life”** → money vs capital market
* **“Liquid vs Opaque”** → traditional vs alternatives

---
**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.04: Securities)**
Concise. Exam-ready. Memory-oriented.

---

# TLDR (first-principles)

Every security answers two questions:

1. **Who owes whom?**
2. **What is the payoff rule?**

Securities fall into three families because they represent **different payoff rules**:

* **Fixed income** = promised cashflows
* **Equity** = ownership of residual value
* **Pooled vehicles** = shared ownership of a managed portfolio

If a payoff is predetermined → fixed income.
If a payoff depends on business performance → equity.
If a payoff comes from a portfolio another manager runs → pooled investment.

---

# 1. SECURITIES — THE THREE BIG FAMILIES

## A. Fixed Income (Debt)

**Definition:**
Promises to repay borrowed money on a schedule (interest + principal).

**Examples:**
Bonds, notes, bills, CDs, commercial paper, repos, mortgages, loan agreements.

### Key Characteristics

* Contractual cashflow schedule
* Payment can be fixed or formula-based (floater linked to interest rate or commodity price)
* Investors are lenders, not owners
* Priority over equity in liquidation
* Lower risk, lower expected return (generally)

### Important Subcategories

* **Notes vs Bonds:**
  Notes = shorter maturity (<10 yrs)
  Bonds = longer (>10 yrs)
  (But practically used interchangeably.)

* **Short-term (<1–2 yrs), Intermediate, Long-term (>5–10 yrs)**
  No universal definition.

* **Money market instruments** (≤ 1 yr):
  T-bills, commercial paper, CDs, repos.

* **Convertible bonds:**
  Debt with option to convert into equity.
  Valued like a bond when conversion unlikely, like equity when conversion likely.

* **Repo:**
  Collateralized short-term borrowing: sell security today, buy back tomorrow at higher price.

**Memory Hook:**
*Fixed income = “I promise to pay you exactly X at time Y.”*

---

## B. Equities (Ownership)

**Definition:**
Represent ownership rights in a corporation.

### 1. Common Shares

* Residual claim after all liabilities
* Voting rights
* Dividends not guaranteed
* Higher risk, higher upside

### 2. Preferred Shares

* Priority over common in dividends and liquidation
* Often fixed dividend → equity that behaves like debt
* Cumulative preferred: missed dividends must be paid before common gets any

### 3. Warrants

* Right to buy issuer’s stock at a fixed exercise price before expiry
* Issued by the company (unlike exchange-traded options)
* Are considered equities because exercising creates new equity

**Memory Hook:**
*Common = ownership.
Preferred = ownership with a coupon.
Warrants = ticket to buy equity later.*

---

# 2. POOLED INVESTMENT VEHICLES

They bundle investor capital into one portfolio.

## A. Mutual Funds

* **Open-ended:**

  * Issue new shares + redeem existing ones daily
  * Investors trade directly with the fund
  * Trade at **NAV**

* **Closed-ended:**

  * Issue once via primary market
  * After that, traded in secondary market
  * Price can deviate from NAV (often trades at discount)
  * Discount reflects: expenses, manager quality concerns, market sentiment

## B. ETFs / ETNs

* Open-ended
* Traded in secondary markets like stocks
* Prices stay near NAV due to **Authorized Participants (APs)**:

  * If ETF price < NAV → APs buy ETF, redeem at NAV → push price up
  * If ETF price > NAV → APs buy from fund at NAV, sell ETF → push price down
* Many require **in-kind** creations/redemptions

## C. Depository Receipts

Proof of owning a deposited portfolio of securities
(e.g., warehouse receipts for metals).

## D. Hedge Funds

* Usually structured as **limited partnerships**
* Managers = general partners
* Investors (qualified) = limited partners
* Very broad strategies (arbitrage, macro, long–short, alternatives)
* Key characteristics:

  * Performance-based fees
  * High leverage
  * High risk tolerance
  * Light regulatory oversight

## E. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)

* Backed by pools of loans (mortgages, credit cards, car loans)
* Cashflows passed through to holders
* Tranches allocate different cashflow rights & different risk levels

**Memory Hook:**
*Pooled vehicles = “I give money → manager invests → I get my share.”*

---

# 3. WHAT DISTINGUISHES FIXED INCOME vs EQUITY? (CFA Example 6)

### Fixed Income

* Contractual cashflows
* Valued based on ability to pay
* Lender relationship
* Priority in liquidation

### Equity

* Ownership
* Residual claim
* No promised cashflows
* Higher risk, higher expected return

**Core contrast:**
*Debt gives scheduled payments; equity gives whatever is left.*

---

# 4. FAST REVISION TABLE

### Fixed Income

* Promised payments
* Short-term: bills, CP, CDs, repos
* Long-term: bonds, notes
* Special: convertibles, ABS

### Equities

* Ownership
* Common + preferred
* Warrants

### Pooled Vehicles

* Mutual funds (open/closed)
* ETFs/ETNs
* Depository receipts
* Hedge funds
* ABS

### Key Concepts to Memorize

* Convertible bonds = hybrid
* Preferred shares = equity with bond-like cashflow
* Closed-end funds trade at discount/premium
* ETFs stay near NAV due to AP arbitrage
* ABS = tranches + pass-through

---

# 5. Memory Hooks (High-Yield)

* **Debt = “promised cash.” Equity = “whatever is left.”**
* **Convertible = “bond with an escape hatch to equity.”**
* **Preferred = “equity wearing a bond’s clothes.”**
* **Closed-end = “NAV is not the price.”**
* **ETF = “NAV glued by AP arbitrage.”**
* **ABS = “loans sliced into classes.”**
* **Hedge fund = “high-leverage, high-fee strategy machine.”**

---

**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.05: Currencies, Commodities, and Real Assets)**
Concise. Exam-focused. First-principles reasoning.

---

# TLDR (first principles)

Everything here boils down to **what is being traded and why**:

* **Currencies** → money itself
* **Commodities** → standardized physical goods
* **Real assets** → unique physical properties (real estate, machinery, aircraft)

The more **standardized** the asset is → the more **liquid** the market.
The more **unique** the asset is → the more **illiquid, hard-to-value, and operationally heavy** it becomes.

---

# 1. CURRENCIES

**Definition:** National monies issued by monetary authorities.

### Reserve currencies

Held in bulk by central banks because they are liquid, stable, and widely trusted.

* Primary: USD, EUR
* Secondary: GBP, JPY, CHF

### Markets

Currencies trade in **FX markets**, split into:

1. **Spot FX**

   * Immediate/near-immediate exchange
   * Settlement usually T+2
   * Large institutional sizes (e.g., USD 1M lots)

2. **Retail FX**

   * Banks, ATMs, cards, airport kiosks
   * High spreads, small size

**Memory hook:**
*Currency = an asset whose only payoff is itself.*

---

# 2. COMMODITIES

**Examples:**
Precious metals (gold), energy (oil), industrial metals (copper), agricultural goods (wheat), carbon credits.

### Two ways to trade:

1. **Spot**

   * Immediate physical delivery
   * Used mostly by producers/processors (they can store & use)

2. **Futures/Forwards**

   * Preferred by investors & hedge funds
   * No need to take delivery
   * High liquidity
   * Easy to close positions

### Who uses spot markets?

* Miners
* Farmers
* Industrial processors
  They have storage capacity and knowledge about product quality differences.

### Who uses futures?

* Investment managers
* Speculators
* Hedge funds
  Because they can’t handle physical goods.

### Which commodities are easiest to trade physically?

Non-perishable, high value-to-weight ratio, uniform quality:

* Gold
* Diamonds
* Copper, Aluminum
* Carbon credits

**Memory hook:**
*Spot = physical world. Futures = financial world.*

---

# 3. REAL ASSETS

**Definition:** Unique tangible properties such as:

* Real estate
* Aircraft
* Machinery
* Timber/lumber stands

### Why they appeal to investors

* Income (rent, lease revenue)
* Tax advantages
* Low correlation with stocks/bonds

### Problems

* Very illiquid
* Heterogeneous (no two identical)
* Hard to value
* High management cost (maintenance, operations)

### Why valuation is difficult

Each asset differs in:

* Location
* Remaining life
* Quality & condition
* Suitability (use case)

### Direct vs Indirect investment

* **Direct** → own the property itself

  * High cost, high complexity
* **Indirect** → own securities backed by real assets

  * REITs
  * Master limited partnerships (MLPs)
  * Shares in companies specializing in specific assets (e.g., aircraft leasing companies)

Indirect vehicles make real-asset exposure:

* Divisible
* Homogeneous
* Liquid
  Thus more suitable for portfolios.

**Memory hook:**
*Real assets = unique, illiquid, operationally messy.*

---

# 4. EXAMPLE 7 — CLASSIFICATION LOGIC (Exam Pattern)

A clean summary of how to classify the list:

### **Ownership in corporations**

* Common stock
* Preferred stock

### **Debt instruments**

* Bank deposits
* CDs
* Corporate bonds
* Mortgages
* Treasury notes

### **Trader-created derivative contracts**

(not issued by corporations or governments)

* Lumber forward
* Crude oil futures
* Stock options
* Interest rate swaps

### **Pooled investment vehicles**

* ETFs
* Hedge funds
* Mutual funds

### **Real assets**

* Real estate parcels
* Gold
* Lumber stands (raw lumber is real asset; lumber forward is derivative)

### **Hedging tool for home builder**

* Lumber forward contract

### **Asset used for cross-border corporate cash movement**

* Currencies

---

# 5. FAST REVISION TABLE

### Currencies

* Money itself
* Spot FX = T+2 settlement
* Reserve currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF

### Commodities

* Precious metals, energy, agriculture, industrial metals
* Spot vs futures markets
* Producers use spot; traders use futures
* Low-storage-cost goods trade well physically

### Real Assets

* Real estate, aircraft, machinery, timber
* Heterogeneous
* Illiquid
* Hard to value
* High management cost
* Indirect exposure via REITs, MLPs, specialized companies

---

# 6. Memory Hooks (Use Before Exam)

* **Currencies = money that trades like an asset.**
* **Commodities = standardized physical goods → futures market.**
* **Real assets = unique, illiquid, management-heavy physical properties.**
* **Futures = financial way to avoid touching the physical commodity.**
* **REITs/MLPs = make real assets liquid.**

* **mnemonics** for fast recall, or
* **CFA-style practice questions** to test mastery.
Concise. High-yield. Built for last-minute revision + retention.  
Includes **Jargons**, **Core Concepts**, **Memory Hooks**, **Examples**, and **Exam Flags**.

---

# **JARGONS (Simple English, Zero Confusion)**

- **Underlying** – The thing the contract’s value depends on (gold, stock, index, oil, rate, currency).
    
- **Derivative** – A contract whose value _derives from_ an underlying.
    
- **Spot Contract** – Immediate delivery (within ≈3 days).
    
- **Forward** – One future exchange at a pre-agreed price.
    
- **Futures** – Standardised forward + clearinghouse guarantee + daily settlement.
    
- **Counterparty Risk** – The risk the other party refuses or fails to settle.
    
- **Margin (Initial/Maintenance)** – Money you deposit to protect against default; must top up when losses occur.
    
- **Swap** – Exchange of future cash flows at multiple dates.
    
- **Interest Rate Swap (IRS)** – Exchange fixed vs floating interest payments.
    
- **Commodity Swap** – Fixed payments vs commodity-linked payments.
    
- **Currency Swap** – Exchange interest + principal in two currencies.
    
- **Equity Swap** – Fixed payments vs stock or index returns.
    
- **Option** – Right, not obligation, to buy/sell an underlying.
    
- **Call** – Right to buy.
    
- **Put** – Right to sell.
    
- **European** – Exercise only at maturity.
    
- **American** – Exercise anytime up to maturity.
    
- **Option Premium** – Price of buying the option.
    
- **Exercise** – Using the right to buy/sell.
    
- **CDS (Credit Default Swap)** – Insurance against bond default.
    

---

# **MASTER MEMORY HOOKS**

- **“Forward = One future handshake.”**
    
- **“Futures = Forward + Safety + Liquidity.”**
    
- **“Swap = Series of forwards stitched together.”**
    
- **“Option = You decide. Forward = You must.”**
    
- **“CDS = Insurance on bonds.”**
    

---

# **1. WHAT IS A CONTRACT? (First Principles)**

A contract = an agreement _today_ to do something in the _future_.  
Its value depends on an **underlying**.  
Settlement can be **physical** (deliver the actual thing) or **cash-settled** (just pay the difference).

**Memory Hook:**  
**“Physical = truck delivery. Cash = spreadsheet delivery.”**

---

# **2. SPOT vs FORWARD vs FUTURES**

## **Spot Contracts**

- “Now” exchange (≈ within 3 days).
    
- No futurity.
    

## **Forward Contracts**

- One transaction in the future at a fixed price.
    
- Fully customizable.
    
- Used by hedgers.
    
- Huge problems:
    
    - **Counterparty risk**
        
    - **Low liquidity** (cannot easily exit)
        

**Memory Hook:**  
**“Forward = private deal + no escape hatch.”**

### **Forward Example (Avocado Farmer)**

- Farmer fixes price via forward → protects downside.
    
- If spot price collapses → forward gains offset crop loss.
    

---

# **3. FUTURES CONTRACTS**

A **standardized forward** traded on exchanges.  
A **clearinghouse** guarantees both sides → eliminates counterparty risk.  
Marked-to-market **daily** via **margining**.

### **Why Futures Solve Forward Problems**

- Clearinghouse → kills counterparty risk.
    
- Standardization → high liquidity → easy entry/exit.
    
- Daily margining → losses never build up.
    

**Memory Hook:**  
**“Futures: same forward idea, industrial-grade plumbing.”**

### Example (NYMEX Crude)

- Loss per barrel × 1,000 × contracts → margin drop.
    
- If below maintenance → margin call → top up to initial margin.
    

---

# **4. SWAP CONTRACTS**

Agreement to exchange **multiple future cash flows**.

### **Core Types**

- **Interest Rate Swap**: fixed ↔ floating
    
- **Commodity Swap**: fixed ↔ commodity price
    
- **Currency Swap**: payments in two currencies
    
- **Equity Swap**: fixed ↔ equity returns
    

**Memory Hook:**  
**“Swap = A stack of mini-forwards.”**

### Why Investors Use Swaps

- Convert fixed exposure to floating (or vice versa)
    
- Manage duration and rate risk
    
- Hedge commodity exposures
    
- Obtain foreign currency financing
    

---

# **5. OPTION CONTRACTS**

Right, not obligation, to transact at a strike price.

### Types

- **Call** → right to buy
    
- **Put** → right to sell
    

### Exercise Style

- **European** → only at maturity
    
- **American** → anytime until maturity
    

### Why Options Have Premiums

- Holder has _no obligation_; writer has _full obligation_.
    
- Premium compensates writer for asymmetric payoff.
    

**Memory Hook:**  
**“Forward = Must. Option = Maybe.”**

### Payoff Logic

- **Call exercised** if market price > strike
    
- **Put exercised** if market price < strike
    
- Otherwise worthless.
    

---

# **6. SPECIAL CONTRACTS**

## **CFDs (Contracts for Difference)**

- Always **cash settled**.
    
- Retail speculation tool.
    
- Profit = change in underlying × contract size.
    

**Exam Hook:**  
“CFDs are derivatives. CFD on copper is _still_ cash-settled.”

## **Insurance Contracts**

- Pay if a specified event occurs (death, accident, damage).
    
- True hedging instruments.
    

## **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**

- Insurance against corporate bond default.
    
- Buyer pays periodic premium.
    
- Seller pays if default occurs.
    

**Memory Hook:**  
**“CDS = Bond default insurance; buyer wins if issuer dies.”**

---

# **7. CLEAN COMPARISON TABLE (Exam-Favourite)**

|Feature|Forward|Futures|Swap|Option|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Obligation?|Yes|Yes|Yes|No (right only)|
|Exercise?|1 final exchange|Daily MTM + final|Multiple payments|Up to/at expiry|
|Counterparty risk?|High|Very Low (clearinghouse)|Medium|Depends on market|
|Standardized?|No|Yes|Semi|Yes (exchange)|
|Margin?|No|Yes|No|For writers (sometimes)|
|Early exit?|Hard|Easy (offset)|Hard|Sell the option|

---

# **8. EXAM-READY EXAMPLES TO LOCK MEMORY**

### **Forward vs Futures**

- Forward is 1 future deal with one party.
    
- Futures is a forward that _anyone_ can enter + exit; clearinghouse ensures safety.
    

### **Option vs Forward**

- Forward: Both must transact.
    
- Option: Only buyer may choose; writer must obey.
    

### **Swap vs Forward**

- Swap = series of forward-like exchanges.
    
- Forward = single exchange.
    

### **CFD Settlement**

- Always cash-settled, regardless of underlying (stocks, copper, indices).
    

---

# **9. RAPID-REVISION TL;DR**

- Contracts bind future actions; values come from underlying.
    
- Physical settlement = deliver asset. Cash = pay difference.
    
- Forward = private, customizable, high counterparty risk.
    
- Futures = forward + clearinghouse + daily margin → liquid + safer.
    
- Swap = series of future payments: interest, currency, equity, commodity.
    
- Option = right, not obligation. Call buys; put sells.
    
- Insurance + CDS hedge catastrophic risk.

Concise. Dense. First-principles. Exam-ready.

# TLDR (first principles)

Financial intermediaries exist because **buyers and sellers rarely arrive at the same place at the same time with the same information**.
Intermediaries fix this mismatch by:

* finding counterparties
* providing liquidity
* transforming risk
* reducing search, transaction, and information costs

Every intermediary is just a different way of **connecting capital with opportunity**.

---

# 1. WHY FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES MATTER

Intermediaries stand *between* participants and make markets work by:

* Connecting buyers ↔ sellers
* Connecting capital ↔ issuers
* Connecting risks ↔ hedgers
* Enforcing transparency and rules
* Providing liquidity when needed

When intermediaries function well → markets are efficient, transparent, and cheap to trade.
When they fail → markets become illiquid, opaque, expensive.

---

# 2. MAJOR INTERMEDIARIES (Grouped by Function)

---

## A. **Brokers, Exchanges, ATS/ECNs**

**Core function:** Match buyers and sellers. They do *not* take risk.

### 1. Brokers

* Act as **agents**
* Do *not* trade with clients
* Earn **commission**
* Reduce search cost of finding counterparties

**Block brokers**

* Handle **large orders** that would move prices
* Carefully hide big orders to avoid signalling risk

**Memory hook:**
*Broker = matchmaker.*

---

### 2. Investment Banks (Corporate Finance Arm)

* Advise on **IPOs, SEOs, bonds**
* Arrange **M&A transactions**
* Help issuers structure and sell securities

**Not market-makers** here; they’re deal engineers.

---

### 3. Exchanges

* Provide rule-based, transparent venue
* Historically physical; now electronic
* Regulate **listed issuers**
* Require **financial disclosure**
* Prevent abusive capital structures (e.g., unequal voting rights)
* Ensure fair trading rules

**Difference vs brokers?**
Exchanges have **regulatory authority**.

**Examples:** NYSE, CME, TSE, SGX, Eurex.

---

### 4. ATS / ECNs / MTFs (Alternative Trading Systems)

* Function like exchanges but **without issuer regulation**
* Do not enforce listing standards
* Focus solely on trade execution

**Dark pools:**

* Orders not displayed
* Favoured by large investment managers to avoid moving prices
* Examples: Liquidnet, BATS, POSIT, Turquoise

**Memory hook:**
*ATS = exchange without the rulebook.*

---

## B. **Dealers**

**Core function:** Provide **liquidity** by trading from their own inventory.

* Trade **with clients** (principal)
* Buy when clients sell; sell when clients buy
* Profit from the **bid–ask spread**
* Make markets in OTC and exchange venues
* Can be traditional humans or automated systems

**Conflict of Interest:** broker–dealer structure

* Broker side must get best price for client
* Dealer side profits from price differences
* Client must specify how orders are handled

**Primary dealers:**

* Trade directly with central banks in monetary operations

**Memory hook:**
*Dealer = liquidity provider; moves trades across time.*

---

## C. **Arbitrageurs**

**Core function:** Move liquidity **across markets** by exploiting price differences.

* Buy low in one market, sell high in another
* Provide cross-market liquidity
* Rare in “pure” form when identical instruments are efficiently priced
* Often hedge risk by holding combinations of related instruments
* Use **replication** strategies to transform one risk into another

**Key contrast vs dealers:**

* **Dealer:** connects different times (same market)
* **Arbitrageur:** connects different markets (same time)

**Memory hook:**
*Arbitrageur = cross-market glue.*

---

# 3. HOW ARBITRAGE REALLY WORKS (CFA emphasis)

Arbitrageurs rarely buy/sell identical assets. Instead, they exploit **valuation relationships**:

* Sell overpriced call options
* Buy underlying stock
* Hedge risk via delta-hedging
* Replicate payoffs of an option to satisfy demand or absorb excess supply

Arbitrage = **replication + mispricing**.

---

# 5. EXAMPLES (From CFA Text)

### Brokers vs Dealers

* Broker = *agent, no inventory*
* Dealer = *principal, inventory, spread income*

### Dealers vs Arbitrageurs

* Dealer → matches **across time**
* Arbitrageur → matches **across markets**

---

# 6. VALUE ADDED BY FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES

Intermediaries improve market quality by:

* lowering transaction/search cost
* providing liquidity
* enabling risk sharing
* enforcing market rules
* supplying pricing information
* ensuring capital flows efficiently from issuers → investors

**Memory hook:**
*Intermediaries = the plumbing of financial markets.*

---

# 7. Ultra-Condensed Revision Notes

* Brokers = agents; match trades
* Dealers = principals; supply liquidity
* Arbitrageurs = exploit cross-market mispricing
* Exchanges = venues + regulation
* ATS = venues without regulation (dark pools)
* Investment banks = capital raising + M&A
* Primary dealers = central bank counterparties
* All intermediaries reduce frictions and connect buyers ↔ sellers and capital ↔ issuers

---

**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.07: Securitizers, Depository Institutions, Insurance Companies)**
Concise. Dense. First-principles. Exam-ready.

---

# TLDR (first principles)

All intermediaries in this section do one of three things:

1. **Pool** many small assets into big, investable ones (securitizers).
2. **Transform** short-term deposits into long-term loans (banks).
3. **Redistribute** risk away from those who fear it to those who can bear it (insurance companies).

Each solves a fundamental mismatch in the financial system:

* Securitizers solve *liquidity & scale mismatch*.
* Banks solve *time & search mismatch*.
* Insurers solve *risk-bearing mismatch*.

---

# 1. SECURITIZERS

**Core idea:** Convert illiquid, messy assets into liquid securities.

### 1.1 What they do

* Buy many small assets (mortgages, car loans, card receivables)
* Pool them
* Sell claims on that pool as **asset-backed securities (ABS)** or **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)**
* Cashflows from borrowers → passed through to investors
* Pool diversification makes cashflows more predictable

**Memory hook:**
*Securitizer = a factory that turns loans into tradable bonds.*

---

### 1.2 Why securitization exists (first principles)

* Individual loans are risky, illiquid, costly to manage
* A pool of loans is diversified → predictable losses
* Investors want scale and liquidity
* Originators want to sell loans and recycle capital

Outcome:

* Higher mortgage prices = lower borrower interest rates
* Investors get liquid, standardized securities
* Banks free up balance sheet to lend more

---

### 1.3 SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles)

Used to keep securitized assets **off balance sheet**.

Benefits:

* Protects investors if the bank goes bankrupt
* Provides “bankruptcy-remote” structure
* Makes claims on the asset pool clearer

**Memory hook:**
*SPV = vault that holds assets safely away from the bank.*

---

### 1.4 Tranching

* Pool’s cashflows are sliced into **senior → mezzanine → junior (toxic waste)**
* Senior: safer, first in line
* Junior: absorbs excess risk

Important exam note:
**Risk of the pool cannot change** → slicing only redistributes who bears it.

---

### 1.5 ETFs as securitization

ETFs are essentially ABS backed by portfolios of traded securities.
Trading an ETF = trading the entire portfolio in one shot.

---

# 2. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS

**Examples:** commercial banks, savings & loan banks, credit unions.

### 2.1 What banks do

* Accept deposits
* Provide payments (checking, transfers)
* Lend to borrowers
* Transform **many small deposits → fewer large loans**

**Memory hook:**
*Bank = matchmaker + payment system + credit engine.*

---

### 2.2 Why banks are intermediaries

They connect:

* **Depositors** → want safety + liquidity
* **Borrowers** → want large, long-term funding

Banks handle:

* Credit analysis
* Loan servicing
* Default risk management
* Diversification across many borrowers

---

### 2.3 Capital structure of a bank (exam concept)

Deposits = **senior tranche**
Other creditors = intermediate tranche
Equity = **junior tranche** (absorbs losses first)

Why this matters:

* Low equity capital → moral hazard
* Poorly capitalized lenders lend recklessly
* Depositors demand high interest → funding becomes expensive

**Memory hook:**
*Bank equity = junior tranche of a loan pool.*

---

### 2.4 Other credit corporations

Acceptance companies, payday lenders, discount corporations, factoring companies.
They:

* Lend against receivables, machinery, paychecks
* Finance themselves via CP, bonds, equity
* Connect investors to borrowers just like banks
* But usually serve riskier segments

**Prime brokers**

* Brokers who lend to hedge funds
* Provide leverage, margin loans, securities lending

---

# 3. INSURANCE COMPANIES

**Core function:** Transfer risk from insured → insurer.

### 3.1 How insurance works (first principles)

One person cannot predict their loss, but a **large pool** can predict aggregate losses extremely well because events are usually uncorrelated.

More predictable → lower cost of bearing risk → cheaper insurance.

Insurers:

* Price policies
* Collect premiums
* Pay claims
* Diversify across large pools
* Buy reinsurance for risks they don’t want

---

### 3.2 Who bears the risk?

The insurer’s:

* equity holders
* creditors
* reinsurers

All indirectly absorb insured losses.

---

### 3.3 Market failures insurance must manage

* **Fraud**: fake losses
* **Moral hazard**: insured act carelessly
* **Adverse selection**: only high-risk buyers apply

This is why insurers require:

* disclosure, documentation
* deductibles
* co-pays
* underwriting
* exclusion clauses

**Memory hook:**
*Insurance = risk transfer + risk control.*

---

### 3.4 CDS (credit default swaps)

Insurance-like contracts that:

* Pay if a bond defaults
* Often sold by banks or hedge funds, not just insurers
* Traditionally lacked reserve requirements (key difference)

---

# 4. EXAMPLE 16 — COMMERCIAL BANKS

**Why they are intermediaries:**

* Collect deposits
* Lend to borrowers
* Provide payment services
* Connect savers ↔ borrowers
* Provide liquidity + credit evaluation + risk transformation

---

# 5. ULTRA-COMPACT REVISION NOTES

### Securitizers

* Pool loans → issue ABS/MBS
* Improve liquidity, diversification
* Use SPVs to isolate assets
* Tranches redistribute risk
* ETFs = securitized portfolios

### Depository Institutions

* Accept deposits; make loans
* Payment services
* Transform maturity + size
* Depositors = senior; equity = junior
* Prime brokers provide margin finance

### Insurance Companies

* Sell policies to transfer risk
* Predictable losses via diversification
* Manage fraud, adverse selection, moral hazard
* Transfer unwanted risk via reinsurance
* CDS = insurance-like but unregulated historically

---

# 6. MEMORY HOOKS (High-yield)

* **Securitizer = loan blender** → turns many small, illiquid loans into liquid securities.
* **SPV = bankruptcy-proof vault.**
* **Bank = deposit transformer** → short-term deposits → long-term loans.
* **Insurance = risk recycler** → takes concentrated risks and diversifies them.
* **Tranching = slicing the same risk pie into safe and risky slices.**

---
**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.08: Leveraged Positions)**
Concise. Dense. First-principles. Exam-ready.

---

# TLDR (first principles)

Leverage means **using borrowed money to control a bigger position than your equity alone allows**.
This amplifies returns:

* small price gains → big equity gains
* small price losses → big equity losses

Margin trading requires:

* **initial margin** (equity you put in)
* **maintenance margin** (minimum ongoing equity)
* **margin call price** (price where equity falls below maintenance)

The math is simple:

* Leverage Ratio = Position Value ÷ Equity
* Return on Equity = (Ending Equity − Initial Equity) ÷ Initial Equity
* Margin Call Price solves: Equity ÷ Position Value = maintenance %

---

# 1. BUYING ON MARGIN — FIRST PRINCIPLES

When you buy a security with borrowed money:

* Broker lends you the margin loan
* You pay interest at the **call money rate**
* Your equity = portion you paid
* Total position value = equity + borrowed funds

**Leverage = bigger exposure with same equity** → magnifies gains/losses.

**Memory hook:**
*Margin = renting buying power.*

---

# 2. MARGIN DEFINITIONS

### **Initial Margin Requirement**

Minimum fraction of purchase price you must fund yourself.
Example: If IMR = 40%, you pay 40% and borrow 60%.

### **Maintenance Margin Requirement**

Minimum ongoing equity level relative to market value (often 25%).
If your equity falls below this → **margin call**.

### **Portfolio Margining**

Broker uses risk models to allow lower margin for diversified portfolios.

---

# 3. LEVERAGE RATIO

$$
\text{Leverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Position Value}}{\text{Equity}}
$$

Max leverage = (1 / \text{Initial Margin Requirement})

Example:

* IMR = 40% → Max leverage = 2.5
* IMR = 20% → Max leverage = 5

**Interpretation:**
How many times your equity the position is.

**Risk scaling:**
A 10% price move gives ≈ Leverage × 10% equity return (ignoring interest, commissions).

---

# 4. RETURN ON LEVERAGED POSITION

Total return involves:

* price change
* dividends/interest received
* interest paid on margin loan
* buy/sell commissions

General structure:

$$
\text{Equity}_{\text{end}}
= \text{Proceeds from sale}

* \text{Loan repayment}
* \text{Margin interest}

- \text{Dividends}

* \text{Commissions}
  $$

$$
\text{Return}
= \frac{\text{Equity}*{\text{end}} - \text{Equity}*{\text{initial}}}{\text{Equity}_{\text{initial}}}
$$

---

# 5. CFA EXAMPLE 19 — How the return is computed

**Given:**

* Buy 1,000 shares at $20 → $20,000
* Leverage 2.5 → equity 40% (= $8,000)
* Borrow 60% (= $12,000)
* Dividends = $100
* Commissions = $20 total
* Interest = 5% of $12,000 = $600
* Sell at $15 → $15,000

### Ending equity

Two ways to compute (both equivalent):

**Method A — Start from initial investment**
Initial equity = $8,010
Loss from price change = –$5,000
Interest = –$600
Dividend = +$100
Commissions = –$20

Ending equity = **$2,490**

**Method B — Start from sale proceeds**
Sale proceeds = $15,000
Less loan repayment = –$12,000
Less interest = –$600
Plus dividends = +$100
Less commission = –$10

Ending equity = **$2,490**

### Total return

$$
\frac{2,490 - 8,010}{8,010} = -68.9%
$$

### Why return is worse than –25% price drop?

* Leverage amplifies returns:
  Price drop = –25% → leveraged impact = –62.5% (2.5×)
* Additional cost: interest + commissions → extra loss

---

# 6. MARGIN CALL PRICE — FIRST PRINCIPLES

Let:

* (P_0) = initial price
* (P) = current price
* IMR = initial margin %
* MMR = maintenance margin %

### Equity per share:

$$
\text{Equity} = \text{IMR} \cdot P_0 + (P - P_0)
$$

### Condition for margin call:

$$
\frac{\text{Equity}}{P} = \text{MMR}
$$

### CFA Example 20

* (P_0 = 20)
* IMR = 40% → initial equity/share = 8
* MMR = 25%
  Solve:

$$
\frac{8 + (P - 20)}{P} = 0.25
$$

Simplify:

$$
8 + P - 20 = 0.25P
$$

$$
P - 12 = 0.25P
$$

$$
0.75P = 12
$$

$$
P = 16
$$

Below $16 → margin call.

---

# 7. SHORT POSITIONS

Short sellers also borrow (but borrow shares instead of money).

* They post margin
* If the price **rises**, equity falls
* If equity < maintenance margin → broker forces buy-back

**Memory hook:**
*Long on margin = borrow cash.
Short on margin = borrow stock.*

---

# 8. ULTRA-COMPACT REVISION NOTES

### Core formulas

* Leverage = Position / Equity
* Max leverage = 1 / IMR
* Margin call price solves:
  $$
  \frac{\text{IMR}\cdot P_0 + (P - P_0)}{P} = \text{MMR}
  $$

### What leverage does

* Magnifies returns (both ways)
* Adds interest cost
* Can wipe out equity quickly

### Margin terms

* **Initial margin**: minimum equity at purchase
* **Maintenance margin**: ongoing minimum
* **Call money rate**: interest on borrowed funds
* **Margin call**: when equity < maintenance
* **Portfolio margining**: risk-based margin (lower for diversified portfolios)

### Risk takeaway

A leveraged position can lose more than 100% of equity unless brokers intervene with maintenance margin rules.

---

# 9. MEMORY HOOKS

* **“Borrowed money multiplies pain and pleasure.”**
* **“Margin call = price where your safety cushion disappears.”**
* **“Leverage ratio = position size in units of your equity.”**
* **“Initial margin = down payment; maintenance margin = ongoing cushion.”**


**TEACHING NOTES — CFA L1 | EQUITY (Section 1.09: Positions and Short Positions)**
Concise. Dense. First-principles. Exam-ready.

---

# TLDR (first principles)

A **position** is simply how much of something you **own** (long) or **owe** (short).

* **Long = own** → benefit if price rises.
* **Short = owe** → benefit if price falls.

Every derivative (futures, forwards, options, swaps) also has a **long side** and a **short side**, defined by **who benefits from a price increase** and **who carries the obligation**.

Long positions have limited downside.
Short positions have potentially unlimited downside.

---

# 1. WHAT A POSITION ACTUALLY IS (first principles)

A position = quantity of an asset or contract:

* **Positive quantity** → long
* **Negative quantity** → short

A portfolio = collection of such positions.

**Memory hook:**
*A long owns; a short owes.*

---

# 2. LONG POSITIONS

You bought/own the asset or contract.
You benefit when its price **increases**.

Examples:

* Long stocks
* Long bonds
* Long gold
* Long real estate
* Long futures (obligation to buy later)
* Long call or long put option (you bought the right)

**Risk profile:**

* Max loss = 100%
* Upside = unlimited (for stocks/commodities)

---

# 3. SHORT POSITIONS

You sold something you **do not own** or you **wrote the contract**.
You benefit when the price **decreases**.

Examples:

* Short stocks (you borrow them, sell them, plan to buy back cheaper)
* Short futures (obligation to deliver later)
* Short calls / short puts (you are the writer)

**Risk profile:**

* Max gain = 100%
* Loss = unlimited (because price can rise infinitely)

**Memory hook:**
*Long = upside lover.
Short = betting against price, unlimited risk.*

---

# 4. HEDGERS ALSO TAKE LONG/SHORT POSITIONS

Hedgers pick the side that offsets their business risk.

Example:

* A wire manufacturer holding physical copper
  → exposed to copper price falling
  → hedges by **shorting copper futures**
  → fall in copper price:

  * loss on physical copper
  * gain on futures short

If the exposure is *positively correlated* → hedge with a **short**.
If it is *negatively correlated* → hedge with a **long**.

---

# 5. LONG/SHORT IN CONTRACTS (VERY TESTED)

### A. Forwards & Futures

* **Long** → obligated to take delivery
* **Short** → obligated to deliver
* Long benefits when underlying price rises
* Short benefits when price falls

---

### B. Options

Confusion arises because **long put is short exposure to underlying**.

Correct mapping:

| Instrument | Position | Exposure to Underlying |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Call       | Long     | Long exposure          |
| Call       | Short    | Short exposure         |
| Put        | Long     | Short exposure         |
| Put        | Short    | Long exposure          |

**Interpretation:**

* Long call = bullish
* Long put = bearish
* Short call = bearish
* Short put = bullish

**Memory hook:**

* *Holder always has rights; writer always has obligations.*
* *Long put makes money when price falls → indirect short.*

---

### C. Swaps

No physical underlying.
Convention:

* Long = the side that benefits when **quoted price increases** (e.g., fixed-rate receiver in a swap if swap rate rises).

---

### D. Currency Contracts

Currencies come in pairs.
Being long one currency is always short the other.

Example:
“I’m long USD against JPY” = bought USD, sold JPY.

---

# 6. SHORT SELLING SECURITIES (MECHANICS)

### How to short a stock

1. Borrow shares from a long investor (via broker).
2. Sell borrowed shares in the market.
3. Post collateral; earn/pay **short rebate rate**.
4. Later buy back shares (“cover”) and return them.

### Payments-in-lieu

Short seller must pay lender:

* dividends
* interest
* adjustments for splits

Because lender temporarily loses ownership benefits.

### Difficulty: “Hard to borrow”

Short rebate rate can be very low or negative.
Such stocks are said to be **on special**.

---

# 7. RISK PROFILES (Most examable)

### Long position

* Upside: unlimited
* Downside: capped at 100%

### Short position

* Upside: capped at 100%
* Downside: unlimited

Example:
Shorting Yahoo! at $20 in 1996 → price rose to $1,500 → catastrophic loss (75× increase).

---

# 8. CONTRACT SHORTING VS SECURITY SHORTING

**Shorting a stock**

* Must borrow it
* Must post collateral
* Must pay dividends-in-lieu
* Risk: unlimited losses if price rises

**Shorting an option**

* No borrowing
* You *create* the contract by writing it
* Obligations defined by the option
* Risk depends on type:

  * Short call = unlimited risk
  * Short put = substantial but limited risk

**Memory hook:**
*Shorting a contract = you become the issuer.*

---

# 9. EXAMPLE 18 — KEY LOGIC

Short selling shares of Siemens:

* Must **borrow shares first** then sell
  Short selling a Siemens call option:
* No borrowing; **writing the contract creates it**

---

# 10. ULTRA-COMPACT REVISION NOTES

### Long

* Own the asset
* Gains if price ↑
* Loss capped
* Option long: has rights

### Short

* Owe/sold asset not owned
* Gains if price ↓
* Loss unbounded
* Option short: has obligations

### Option mapping

* Long call → long exposure
* Short call → short exposure
* Long put → short exposure
* Short put → long exposure

### Short selling

* Borrow shares
* Pay dividends-in-lieu
* Collateral posted
* Rebate rate / “on special” conditions

### Hedging principle

* Correlated risk → short the hedging instrument
* Inversely correlated → long the hedging instrument

---

# 11. MEMORY HOOKS

* **“Long owns; short owes.”**
* **“Calls follow the stock; puts move opposite.”**
* **“Short stock = borrow → sell → buy back.”**
* **“Writer = contract creator; holder = rights.”**
* **“Shorts can lose infinity; longs only 100%.”**
