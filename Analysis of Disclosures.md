Below is a **dense, clean, first-principles explanation** of the PDF *Using Disclosures in Analysis* — in your exact style: concise, analytical, memory-hook-driven, exam-ready. All citations reference the uploaded file.

# **TL;DR (First Principles)**

Disclosures about long-lived assets help an analyst answer three questions:

1. **How productive are a firm’s assets?** → fixed asset turnover.
2. **How old are the assets?** → estimated age & remaining life.
3. **Is the firm reinvesting enough?** → compare depreciation vs capital expenditure.

Memory hook: **“Turnover–Age–Reinvestment: the T-A-R framework.”**

# **1. Why Disclosures Matter (Page 1)**

Companies report PPE and intangible data across financial statements. Analysts use these disclosures to estimate:

* **Efficiency** (Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenues / Avg Net PPE)
* **Asset age** (historical cost vs accumulated depreciation)
* **Reinvestment need** (Capex vs Depreciation)
* **Remaining useful life** (how soon PPE must be replaced)

Under IFRS (but not GAAP), revaluation model complicates comparisons because carrying amounts differ from depreciated cost. Hence analysis usually focuses on PPE reported under **cost model**.

Memory hook: **“If revalued → ignore for ratio analysis.”**

---

# **2. Estimating Asset Age & Remaining Life (Page 1)**

If firm uses **straight-line depreciation** and historical cost model:

### **Estimated total useful life**

Total useful life ≈ Historical cost ÷ Annual depreciation expense

### **Estimated age**

Age ≈ Accumulated depreciation ÷ Annual depreciation expense

### **Remaining life**

Remaining life ≈ Total useful life − Age
or
Remaining life ≈ Net PPE ÷ Annual depreciation expense

Memory hook: **“Life = Cost/Dep; Age = Acc/Dep; Remaining = NetPPE/Dep.”**

These mechanical formulas come directly from the identity:

Historical cost = Accumulated depreciation + Net PPE

Shown in the table on page 1.

# **3. Example Setup — Three Telecom Firms (Page 1–2)**

The PDF compares:

* **Orange SA** (IFRS)
* **BCE Inc.** (IFRS)
* **Verizon** (US GAAP)

Page 2 gives the table called *Exhibit 6* with each firm’s:

* Historical cost PPE
* Accumulated depreciation
* Net PPE
* Revenues
* Annual depreciation
* Capex
* Accounting standards & depreciation method

These disclosures allow the analyst to compute useful life, age, and turnover ratios.

---

# **4. Estimating Useful Life, Age, Remaining Life (Page 2)**

Using the formulas above, the PDF computes:

### **Estimated total useful life**

* Orange ≈ 29.6 years
* BCE ≈ 22.8 years
* Verizon ≈ 16.7 years

Interpretation: Verizon depreciates PPE faster / has shorter-lived assets; Orange’s assets have the longest expected life.

### **Estimated age**

* Orange ≈ 15.9 years
* BCE ≈ 14.7 years
* Verizon ≈ 9.9 years

Interpretation: Verizon has the **newest** PPE; Orange/BCE have older assets.

### **Remaining useful life**

* Orange ≈ 13.7 years
* BCE ≈ 8.1 years
* Verizon ≈ 6.8 years

Interpretation: Verizon will need to replace assets sooner.

Memory hook: **“Older base → higher reinvestment pressure soon.”**

---

# **5. Why Comparisons Are Tricky (Page 2)**

Differences across firms distort comparisons:

* Asset composition
* Mix of owned vs leased assets
* Different depreciation policies
* Revaluations under IFRS
* Acquisitions/disposals
* Reporting of land (non-depreciable)

The PDF notes this explicitly.

Memory hook: **“PPE ≠ comparable unless business models match.”**

---

# **6. Capex vs Depreciation Analysis (Page 3)**

A key reinvestment test:

**If Capex > Depreciation → firm is replacing/upgrading PPE; asset base is growing or being modernized.**
If < → asset base likely shrinking or aging.

In the PDF:

* Orange: Capex ≈ 120% of depreciation
* BCE: Capex ≈ 149%
* Verizon: Capex ≈ 120%

Interpretation:
All three reinvest at a rate **above** depreciation → fleet renewal happening faster than depreciation charges.
Consistent with a **somewhat older asset base** (they need to keep catching up).

Memory hook: **“Capex ÷ Dep: >1 = expansion/renewal, <1 = aging.”**

---

# **7. Fixed Asset Turnover (Page 3)**

Formula:
Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenues ÷ Average Net PPE

From PDF:

* Orange ≈ 1.6
* BCE ≈ 1.0
* Verizon ≈ 1.5

Interpretation:
Orange & Verizon generate more revenue per dollar of PPE than BCE. BCE has heavier / more infrastructural assets relative to revenue.

Memory hook: **“Turnover = efficiency; lower = heavy assets or lower productivity.”**

---

# **8. What the Analyst Learns (Summary from Page 3)**

Using PPE disclosures, analyst can infer:

* **Efficiency** (turnover)
* **Asset age** (accumulated depreciation vs cost)
* **Future cash needs** (remaining life, capex/depreciation)
* **Renewal strategy** (Capex >/< Dep)
* **Comparability issues** across IFRS/GAAP, models, and asset mixes

This integrates ratios with the firm’s real operational strategy.

Memory hook: **“Disclosures → reconstruct the entire asset lifecycle.”**

---

# **9. Ultra-Condensed Exam Revision Notes**

* Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenue / Avg Net PPE → efficiency.
* Total Useful Life = Cost ÷ Depreciation.
* Age = Accumulated Dep ÷ Depreciation.
* Remaining Life = Net PPE ÷ Depreciation.
* Capex > Depreciation → expansion / renewal.
* IFRS revaluation model complicates ratio analysis → cost model preferred.
* Differences in asset composition reduce comparability.
