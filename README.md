"Hello, and thank you for having me. I am [Your Name], a seasoned analytics professional specializing in the intricate realm of regulatory modeling. In my current role at UBS, I hold a pivotal position as the custodian of a sophisticated PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), and EAD (Exposure at Default) forecasting model. This model plays a crucial role in IFRS-9 and CECL compliance, specifically tailored for a highly material US Mortgages portfolio.

This entails a comprehensive understanding of Python, where I leverage advanced programming skills to navigate the intricacies of the model.

Furthermore, my role necessitates not only a deep understanding of modeling methodologies but also an adeptness with cloud infrastructure, reflecting the need for a holistic and forward-thinking approach to financial modeling.

I bring to the table not just technical prowess but a proven track record of successfully managing and evolving complex models in line with the evolving regulatory landscape. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to [Company/Organization] and further enhance the success of your financial analytics team."
