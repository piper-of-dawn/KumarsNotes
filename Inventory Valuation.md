Concise, teacher-style explanation of the PDF **Inventory Valuation: CFA-26-02-LI-B** (all content drawn from the PDF)

# **TL;DR (First Principles)**

Inventory is valued at **lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV)** so that you **don’t overstate assets**.
If NRV falls (damage, obsolescence, lower selling price), you **write down** inventory → expense hits income statement → profitability drops.
Under IFRS you can **reverse** write-downs later; under US GAAP you **cannot**.

---

# **Core Ideas You Must Understand**

## **1. Why inventory is risky**

Inventory can lose value due to:
• Spoilage
• Obsolescence
• Falling selling prices
• Tech changes
This introduces **financial statement risk** because inventory sits as a big asset on the balance sheet.

---

## **2. IFRS Rule: Lower of Cost and NRV**

Based on IAS 2.
**NRV = estimated selling price – costs to complete – costs to sell.**
If NRV < cost → write-down.

Write-down effect:
• Balance sheet: inventory ↓
• Income statement: loss in COGS or a separate expense line
• Ratios: profitability ↓, solvency ↓; but turnover ratios may ↑ (denominator smaller)

---

## **3. Reversal under IFRS**

If NRV later increases (market recovers), IFRS allows **reversal up to original write-down**.
This reduces COGS in the recovery year.

---

## **4. US GAAP Treatment**

• Also uses lower of **cost and NRV**, except LIFO and retail method which use **lower of cost or market** (current replacement cost with boundaries).
• **Write-down reversals prohibited**.
• Write-down always flows through **COGS**.

---

## **5. Special case inventories (IAS 2 exemption)**

Inventories of:
• agricultural products
• forest products
• minerals
• broker-traded commodities

These are measured at **fair value less costs to sell**, and changes go **directly to profit or loss**. No cost-vs-NRV comparison.

# **Examples (From the PDF)**

## **Example 1 – Hatsumei Enterprise** (Page 1–2)

Facts:
2017 ending inventory cost = EUR 52.5m
NRV = 49.4m → → write-down = 3.1m.

### IFRS effect:

2017:
• Write inventory to 49.4m
• Recognize 3.1m loss in income statement

2018:
NRV rises → recovery of 3.3m but limited to original write-down → **recovery = 3.1m**.
• Inventory ↑
• COGS ↓ by the recovery amount

### US GAAP:

2017: write-down recognized (same idea)
2018: **no reversal allowed**

---

## **Example 2 – Volvo Group** (Pages 3–5)

Volvo reports:
• Inventory at lower of cost and NRV
• Has an **inventory obsolescence allowance** (SEK 52,761m in 2017)

Adjusting for no allowance:
• Inventory amounts go up
• COGS goes up (because write-downs removed)
• Profit goes down
• Turnover ratios shift

Key ratio insights:

* **Inventory turnover higher** with write-downs → looks like efficient management
* **Gross margin higher** with write-downs (COGS lower after reversal of allowance movements)
* **Net profit margin slightly higher** with write-downs due to tax impact

# **Mechanics of Write-Down (from the PDF)**

### **When NRV < cost**

Journal entry:

```
Loss on Inventory Write-Down   XXX
    Inventory                                  XXX
```

### **IFRS Reversal**

If NRV recovers later:

```
Inventory                      XXX
    Recovery of Inventory Write-Down   XXX
```

(But capped at the original write-down.)

---

# **Ratio Effects (Important for CFA)**

**Write-down increases turnover ratios**

* Inventory ↓ → denominator ↓ → turnover ↑

**Profitability ratios fall at the time of write-down**

* Profit ↓
* Margins ↓

**Liquidity declines**

* Current assets ↓
* Current ratio ↓
* Quick ratio unaffected (inventory excluded)

---

# **What to Memorize for Exams**

1. **IFRS allows reversal; US GAAP prohibits it.**
2. NRV = selling price − completion costs − selling costs.
3. Write-down hits **income statement immediately**.
4. For brokers and agricultural commodities: use **fair value less costs to sell**.
5. Write-downs make turnover ratios look **better**, margins **worse** (initially).
