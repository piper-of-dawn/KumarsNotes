There are two methods to calculate CFO:
1. **Direct Method:** **You list cash inflows (cash from customers, cash from interest received, etc.) and deduct cash outflows** (cash paid to suppliers, employees, interest, taxes). It presents cash movements explicitly, making it intuitive but requiring detailed cash records.
2. **Indirect Method**: **Starts from net profit and adjusts it to convert accrual accounting numbers into cash**. You add back non-cash expenses (depreciation), remove non-cash gains, and adjust for working capital changes (inventories, receivables, payables).

US GAAP and IFRS

## Question 1

|                | Opening | Closing |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Land           | 100     | 90      |
| P&M Gross      | 500     | 600     |
| P&M Accum Depn | 300     | 350     |
**Information:**
- P&M costing 100 was sold during the year for the profit of 30.
- Depreciation charged to P/L was 130
- Gain on sale of land was 45

Compute Cashflow from Investing activities

#### Land
*Gain on sale of land was 45*
There is no depreciation on land, hence 90 - 100 = (10) worth of land was sold.
Net cash inflow from land = 45+10 = 55 (1)
#### P&M
*P&M costing 100 was sold during the year for the profit of 30.*
Incorporating this information:
P&M should have been: 500 - 100 = 400
However P&M is 600, so Purchases = 200

#### Depreciation
*Depreciation charged to P/L was 130*
Incorporating this information:
Closing Depreciation should have been: 300 + 130 = 430 
Discrepancy = 430 - 350 = 80
The Depreciation of 80 has been disposed off in P&M sold. Hence true cost of P&M sold was 100 - 90 = 20.

Net cashflow from P&M = -200 + 50 = -150 (2)

> Total Cashflow = (1) + (2) = -95 


## Question 2

|                   | Opening | Closing |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Retained Earnings | 1200    | 1450    |
| Dividend Payable  | 100     | 120     |
Net profit is 560. Calculate dividend paid

If nothing was declared then:
Closing Retained Earnings = 1200 + 560  = 1760
Hence Dividend Declared = 1760 - 1450 = 310

If no dividend was paid then:
Closing Dividend would have been = 310 + 100 = 410

Therefore, Dividend Paid = 410 - 120 = 290


## Question 3

Mabel Corporation (MC) reported accounts receivable of USD66 million at the end of its second fiscal quarter. MC had revenues of USD72 million for its third fiscal quarter and reported accounts receivable of USD55 million at the end of its third fiscal quarter. Based on this information, the amount of cash MC collected from customers during the third fiscal quarter is:

As of Q3:

|                | Opening | Closing |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- |
| A/C Receivable | 66      | 55      |
Given Revenue = 72.
Had no revenue was received in cash then
A/C Receivable would have been = 66 + 72 = 138
However it is 55
Hence Cash received from customers = 138 - 55 = 83

## Question 3

Red Road Company, a consulting company, reported total revenues of USD100 million, total expenses of USD80 million, and net income of USD20 million in the most recent year. If accounts receivable increased by USD10 million, how much cash did the company receive from customers?

|            |      |
| ---------- | ---- |
| Revenue    | 100  |
| Expenses   | (80) |
| Net Income | 20   |
A/c Receivable increased by 10 
Had nothing would have been received, A/c receivable must have been increased by 100.
Therefore, Cash received = 90
