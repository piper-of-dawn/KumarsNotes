# Advanced Credit Risk

## ICAAP
- ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process): ICAAP is a framework that banks use to assess and manage their capital adequacy. 
- It is an internal process where banks evaluate their risks, determine the amount of capital needed to cover those risks, and ensure they have adequate capital to withstand unexpected losses. 
- The ICAAP process takes into account various risks faced by the bank, including credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk. 
- It involves conducting stress tests, scenario analyses, and risk modeling to determine the bank's capital needs. ICAAP is also used to ensure that banks comply with regulatory capital requirements, such as those set by BASEL III.
- It is a **5 year forward looking** process.


## Simple Balance Sheet of a Bank

| Assets       | Liabilities |
|--------------|-------------|
| Liquidity    | Deposits    |
| Lending      | Interbank   |
| Fixed Assets | Bonds       |
| --           | Capital     |

- **Deposits**: Deposits are the primary source of funding for banks. They are the cheapest source of funding for banks. They are not sticky and can be withdrawn at any time.
- **Interbank**: Interbank loans are loans between banks. Traditionally, they are short term loans. They are used to manage liquidity. 
- **Bonds**: Bonds are long term loans that a bank has taken. They are expensive source of funding for banks. They are sticky and cannot be withdrawn at any time. 
- **Capital**: Capital is the only permanent source of funding for banks. It is strictly regulated by the regulators.  
- **Liquidity**: These are the assets that can be easily converted into cash, eg: Treasury Bills, Cash, etc.
  - _Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)_: LCR is a regulatory requirement that banks must maintain a minimum amount of liquidity to withstand a 30 day stress scenario.
  - _Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)_: NSFR is a regulatory requirement that banks must maintain a minimum amount of stable funding to withstand a 1 year stress scenario.
- **Lending**: These are the loans that a bank has given to its customers. They are the primary source of income for banks. They are the riskiest assets for banks.
  - _Maturity Ladder_: Maturity ladder is the distribution of loans based on their maturity. It is used to manage liquidity.


 ## Capital Requirements Directive (CRD)
 CRD stands for Capital Requirements Directive. It is a regulatory framework that sets out the capital adequacy requirements for banks and investment firms within the European Union (EU). The CRD is designed to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) standards, particularly Basel II and Basel III, into EU law.
The CRD consists of several directives issued by the European Commission, including the original CRD (CRD I), which was implemented in 2006, and subsequent revisions known as CRD II and CRD IV. CRD IV was a significant update that transposed the Basel III framework into EU law and introduced additional regulatory requirements. 

The key components of CRD IV include:
 1. Improve the quality and quantity of capital base.
 2. Reduce Leverage in the banking system.
 3. Improve short and long term liquidity standards.
 4. Enhancing risk coverage, notable counterparty credit risk.

 ## Three versions of Capital in a Bank's balance shee
 1. **Regulatory Capital**: The amount of capital that a bank is required to maintain by the regulators. It is the minimum amount of capital that a bank must maintain to withstand a 1 year stress scenario. 
 2. **Economic Capital**: The amount of capital that a bank must maintain to absorb expected losses and withstand a 1 year stress scenario. 
 3. **Available Capital Resources**: The amount of capital which is actually held in balance sheet.

## Three Pillars of Basel II framework

### Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements
Pillar 1 sets out the minimum capital requirements that banks must maintain to cover their credit, market, and operational risks. It establishes the methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWAs) based on the level of risk associated with various assets and activities. The two main approaches for calculating capital requirements are the standardized approach, which uses predefined risk weights, and the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their own models to calculate risk weights. Pillar 1 ensures that banks have an adequate level of capital to absorb losses and protect depositors and creditors.

### Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process
Pillar 2 emphasizes the importance of a robust supervisory review process by regulatory authorities. It requires banks to undergo a comprehensive assessment of their risks and ensure they maintain capital levels commensurate with their risk profiles. The supervisory review process involves evaluating banks' risk management systems, internal controls, governance practices, and overall risk appetite. Regulators have the authority to impose additional capital requirements beyond Pillar 1 if they determine that a bank's capital position is inadequate to address specific risks. Pillar 2 promotes effective risk management, strengthens the relationship between banks and regulators, and enhances the overall resilience of the banking system.

### Pillar 3: Market Discipline and Disclosure
Pillar 3 aims to promote market discipline and transparency by requiring banks to disclose relevant information about their risk profile, capital adequacy, and risk management practices. Banks are expected to provide accurate and timely information to market participants, investors, and other stakeholders. This disclosure enables market participants to make informed decisions about a bank's risk profile and financial health. Pillar 3 enhances market discipline, facilitates effective risk assessment by stakeholders, and promotes stability in the financial system. It is governed by IFRS 7, which requires banks to disclose information about their capital structure, risk exposures, and risk management practices.

## Going Concern vs Gone Concern

### Going Concern
The business is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. The business is expected to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) is considered as going concern capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, which primarily comprises common shares and retained earnings, and additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital, which includes instruments like perpetual non-cumulative preference shares.

### Gone Concern
The business is expected to cease operations in the foreseeable future. Common Equity Tier 2 (CET2) are considered as gone concern capital. Tier 2 capital includes items such as subordinated debt, hybrid instruments, and revaluation reserves.

## Capital Adequancy Ratio (CAR)
CAR is a regulatory requirement that banks must maintain a minimum amount of capital to withstand a 1 year stress scenario. It has a significant impact on the bank's ability to lend money. If the CAR is 20%, it means that the bank can lend 5 times the amount of capital it has.

## Risk Weighted Assets (RWA)
RWA stands for Risk-Weighted Assets. It is a measure used in banking to quantify the level of risk associated with a bank's assets, and it serves as the basis for determining capital adequacy requirements. The calculation of risk-weighted assets involves assigning specific risk weights to different categories of assets based on their perceived riskiness. These risk weights reflect the likelihood and potential impact of credit risk, market risk, and operational risk associated with the assets.

## Leverage Ratio
$$ \text{Leverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital}}{\text{Total Exposure}} $$
The leverage ratio measures the amount of capital that a bank holds in relation to its total exposure. Higher it is, more resilient is the bank.
