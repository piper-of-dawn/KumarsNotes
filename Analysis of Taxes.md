# **TL;DR (First Principles)**

Taxes are calculated on **tax rules**, financial statements use **accounting rules**.
Whenever **profit timing** differs between these two worlds, you get a **temporary difference** → this creates a **Deferred Tax Liability (DTL)** or **Deferred Tax Asset (DTA)**.

* **DTL** = “I underpaid tax today because tax rules gave me a *later* recognition of income/expense → I will pay more in future.”
* **DTA** = “I overpaid tax today (or I used losses/expenses differently) → I will pay less in future.”

**Analyst treatment:**

* A DTL is either **real** (future cash outflow) or **fake** (equity-like; never reverses).
* A DTA is only useful if the firm can generate enough future taxable income → otherwise write it down (valuation allowance).

Memory hook:
**“DTL = postponed taxes. DTA = prepaid taxes.”**
# **1. Why Deferred Taxes Exist (First Principles)**

The tax base of an asset/liability is what **tax law** says its future deduction or payment is. The carrying amount is what **accounting** says it is worth.

Whenever these two diverge → timing differences → deferred tax.

Two types of differences:

1. **Temporary** (reversing): origin of DTAs/DTLs
2. **Permanent** (non-reversing): never create deferred taxes

*Examples visible on pp. 284–286:* accelerated depreciation, development costs, interest received in advance → these all shift income timing under tax law vs accounting law .
# **2. How Deferred Tax Liabilities Are Created**

## **Core Mechanism**

A **taxable temporary difference** → accounting carrying value > tax base (or liability’s tax base < carrying amount).
Taxable temporary difference increases future taxable income → → **DTL**.

## **Common Sources (direct from module examples)**

1. **Accelerated tax depreciation** (tax depreciation > accounting depreciation)

   * Taxable income now ↓
   * Future taxable income ↑
   * → DTL
     *Exhibit 6–8 show equipment whose tax base falls faster → creating a DTL each year* .

2. **Revenue recognized earlier for accounting but later for tax**

   * e.g., accounts receivable taxed only when cash received
   * Shown in Example 1 (Accounts receivable: carrying 1,500, tax base 1,218 → DTL) .

3. **Expenses capitalized in accounting but deducted immediately for tax**

   * e.g., development costs (pp. 285)
   * Tax deduction now, accounting expense later → DTL.

**Memory hook:**
**“DTL = tax deferral = tax saving today, payback tomorrow.”**

# **3. How Deferred Tax Assets Are Created**

## **Core Mechanism**

A **deductible temporary difference** → tax base > carrying amount (or liability’s tax base > carrying amount).
Future taxable income ↓ → firm will pay less tax → **DTA**.

## **Common Sources (direct from exhibits)**

1. **Warranty liabilities / provisions**

   * Expensed now under accounting
   * Deductible later for tax
     → DTA.

2. **Advance payments from customers**

   * Taxed immediately, revenue recognized later
     → DTA (Example on p. 293) .

3. **Loss carryforwards**

   * Firm incurs tax losses now; can offset future taxable profits
     → DTA (Exhibit 10: DTA from accumulated loss carryforwards) .

**Memory hook:**
**“DTA = credit note from tax authorities.”**

---

# **4. Permanent vs Temporary Differences (Important for Analysis)**

Permanent differences do **not** reverse → no deferred tax.

Examples (pp. 286):

* Non-deductible donations
* Non-taxable dividend income
* Fines/penalties
* Different rules for interest income (depending on jurisdiction)

**Memory hook:**
**“Permanent = never comes back; ignore for deferred tax.”**

# **5. Analyst Treatment of DTLs and DTAs**

This is the part examiners love.

## **A. How to Classify a DTL for Analysis?**

A DTL is either:

### **(1) A true liability (future tax payment)**

→ If **reversal is expected**.
→ Treat as a liability.
→ Increases future cash outflows.

Example: accelerated depreciation almost always reverses → real DTL.

### **(2) An equity-like account (never reverses)**

→ If the firm continually reinvests in similar assets at similar rates, accelerated depreciation keeps generating new DTLs that never actually unwind in cash terms.
→ Treat as **equity**, not debt.
→ Improves leverage ratios.

Memory hook:
**“Reverses? Liability. Never reverses? Equity.”**

---

## **B. How to Treat DTAs?**

The key analytical question: **Will the company earn enough taxable income to use them?**

### **If yes:**

* Keep as an asset.
* Boosts firm value (lower future taxes).

### **If doubtful:**

* Apply/write down valuation allowance.
* Reduce DTA and reduce equity.

Module shows: valuation allowance reduces DTA and increases tax expense (p. 294 Q8) .

Memory hook:
**“A DTA without future profit = fiction.”**

---

## **C. Effect on Cash Flow & Ratios**

### **Cash taxes paid** ≠ **income tax expense**

Income tax expense = tax payable ± change in deferred taxes (p. 287) .

Thus:

* ↑DTL → lower cash taxes today
* ↓DTL (reversal) → higher cash taxes today
* ↑DTA → higher cash tax today
* ↓DTA (utilization) → lower cash tax today

**Important for FCFF & FCFE adjustments**: deferred tax expense is non-cash → adjust accordingly.

---

## **D. Profitability Ratios**

Ignoring reversals → misstates ROE/ROA.

Example:

* Big DTL build-up reduces current tax expense → inflates net income → overstates profitability.

---

# **6. Examples From the Module (Condensed)**

### **Reston Partners (pp. 289–291)**

* Uses straight-line accounting dep. but accelerated tax dep.
* Tax base < carrying amount each year
  → DTL created each year (GBP 257 → 514 → 771) .

### **Advance payments (p. 293)**

* Cash received now, taxed now, revenue recognized later → tax base > carrying amount
  → DTA.

---

# **7. Quick Decision Tree (My Style)**

**Step 1: Compare carrying amount vs tax base**

* CA > TB → taxable temporary difference → DTL
* CA < TB → deductible temporary difference → DTA

**Step 2: Ask if it reverses**

* Yes → DTL = liability
* No → DTL = equity-like

**Step 3: For DTAs: will the firm earn enough taxable income?**

* Yes → keep
* No → write down

**Step 4: Separate temporary vs permanent**

* Permanent → ignore in deferred taxes
* Temporary → create DTA/DTL

# **7 Flashcards (Active Recall)**

### **FC1**

**Q:** What fundamental condition creates deferred taxes?
**A:** A difference between *carrying amount* (accounting) and *tax base* (tax law) that will reverse in future. 

---

### **FC2**

**Q:** CA > TB for an asset → what happens?
**A:** Taxable temporary difference → future taxable income ↑ → **Deferred Tax Liability**.

---

### **FC3**

**Q:** CA < TB for a liability → what does this generate?
**A:** Deductible temporary difference → **Deferred Tax Asset**.

---

### **FC4**

**Q:** Why do accelerated tax depreciation systems create DTLs?
**A:** Taxable income is suppressed today but increases later → taxes have been postponed.

---

### **FC5**

**Q:** When should an analyst treat a DTL as equity?
**A:** When it is unlikely to reverse (e.g., recurring reinvestment keeps it rolling forward).

---

### **FC6**

**Q:** What determines if a DTA is truly valuable?
**A:** The firm’s ability to generate future taxable income (valuation allowance if doubtful).

---

### **FC7**

**Q:** Do permanent differences create deferred taxes?
**A:** No. They never reverse, thus no DTA/DTL.
