  

TL;DR (casual, first-principles)

  

  

Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is the cash left over after running the business and maintaining it, before deciding how much goes to lenders or owners.

Start from cash flow from operations, add after-tax interest (because interest reduced profit and tax, but FCFF must reflect cash available to all capital providers), and subtract Capex.



Formula:

  

FCFF = CFO + Interest × (1 − Tax rate) − Capex

  

  

  

  

Deep, Socratic, First-Principles Explanation

  

  

  

1. What are we trying to measure?

  

  

Q: Does the profit shown on the income statement tell you how much cash the firm can pay out to lenders and shareholders?

A: No.

Because:

  

- It includes non-cash accounting items.
- It is after interest (which benefits lenders only).
- It ignores reinvestment requirements (Capex).

  

  

We want a number that answers:

  

“How much cash did the business generate that is available to lenders + equity holders after necessary reinvestment?”

  

This is FCFF.

  

  

  

  

2. Start from Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)

  

  

Q: Why begin from CFO instead of Net Income?

A: CFO already removes accounting noise and shows cash created by operations:

  

- Net Income
-   
    

- Non-cash charges
-   
    

-   
    

- / − Working capital adjustments
-   
    

  

  

But CFO is after interest and after tax.

To get a clean measure for the entire firm, we must fix this.

  

  

  

  

3. Why subtract Capex?

  

  

Q: Why can’t the firm distribute all operating cash?

A: Because it must reinvest in long-term assets (plant, software, equipment, etc.).

Capex keeps the business running.

  

Thus:

  

Cash free only after Capex is “free cash.”

  

So we subtract Capex.

  

  

  

  

4. Why add 

after-tax

 interest back?

  

  

(Your intuition was right, but here is the structured, rigorous reasoning.)

  

  

4.1 Start with the observation

  

  

CFO is calculated after:

  

- paying interest to lenders, and
- reducing taxes because interest is tax-deductible.

  

  

This means CFO understates the cash available to both equity + debt holders.

  

  

4.2 Thought experiment (your idea refined)

  

  

Imagine two universes:

  

  

Universe A: The firm has debt

  

  

- It pays interest I to lenders.
- Paying interest reduces taxable income.
- Tax saved = I × tax rate.

  

  

So lenders receive:

  

I (cash outflow)

But the firm also saved taxes equal to I × T.

  

  

Universe B: The firm has no debt

  

  

- No interest deductions.
- Taxable income is higher.
- Taxes paid are higher by: I × T.
- Cash left to all capital providers is I − I×T = I(1−T) lower.

  

  

Key insight:

  

Using debt gives the firm a tax shield equal to I × T.

  

Therefore, to compute the cash available to both equity and debt holders, you must:

  

1. Add back the interest (because it artificially reduced CFO).
2. Subtract the tax shield you would have lost if interest didn’t exist.

  

  

Which exactly is:

  

Interest × (1 − T).

  

  

4.3 First-principles statement

  

  

The firm cannot claim that interest is a “real cost to the firm” because interest is only a cost to equity, not to debt + equity together.

Once we consider the tax shield, the economic burden of interest on total firm cash flow is only I × (1 − T).

  

  

4.4 Clean formula justification

  

  

Thus:

  

FCFF = CFO + Interest × (1 − T) − Capex

  

  

  

  

5. Final clean structure

  

  

  

What each term conceptually means:

  

  

- CFO → cash earned after tax from running operations.
- + Interest × (1 − T) → put back the portion of cash that went to lenders after removing the tax shield, because FCFF must represent cash for both lenders and equity.
- − Capex → ensure only cash left after maintaining the business is counted.

  

  

  

  

  

Memory Hooks (short, exam-oriented)

  

  

  

1. One-liner

  

  

“FCFF is operating cash for everyone, after maintaining the machine.”

  

  

2. Three-verb model

  

  

Run → Reward → Reinvest

  

- Run = CFO
- Reward = add back interest after tax
- Reinvest = subtract Capex

  

  

  

3. Tax-shield intuition

  

  

“Interest leaves the firm but reduces taxes. Add it back minus the tax shield.”

→ exactly I(1 − T).

  

  

4. Universe experiment hook

  

  

Remember your own thought experiment:

  

Universe with debt pays interest but saves tax.

Universe without debt pays no interest but pays more tax.

The difference = I(1 − T) → the true adjustment.
