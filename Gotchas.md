## Impairment Triggers

**B is correct.** Long-lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment **whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable**. This is the 'triggering event' approach.

A is incorrect: **Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life** (like goodwill) are reviewed for impairment **annually**. Tangible assets use the 'triggering event' approach.

C is incorrect: The trigger is the *indication* that the carrying amount *may not* be recoverable. The formal test that compares the fair value to the carrying amount is the second step of the review process, conducted *after* the trigger is identified.

### Analytical Challenges from Policy Choices

**B is correct.** The **choice of different methods and varying accounting policies for long-lived assets can create challenges for analysts comparing companies**. Even under the same GAAP (IFRS or US GAAP), companies have choices, such as selecting different useful lives or depreciation methods (e.g., straight-line vs. double-declining balance). These choices directly impact reported net income, assets, and cash flow from operations, necessitating adjustments by the analyst for an 'apples-to-apples' comparison.

A is incorrect: While using different GAAPs (IFRS vs. US GAAP) is a major challenge (e.g., R&D expensing, impairment reversal), the text specifically highlights that the choice of different methods for long-lived assets within the standards creates challenges.

C is incorrect: If both companies use the same GAAP and the same accounting policies, the challenge for comparison is minimized

### IFRS Impairment Reversal Reporting

**C is correct.** IFRS **permit impairment losses to be reversed** (up to the carrying amount the asset would have had if no impairment loss was recognized). When an impairment loss is reversed, the reversal is reported as a **gain in profit** (i.e., on the income statement). This increase in profit restores the value previously recognized as a loss, impacting the current period's earnings.

### GAAP's Feasibility Gate

**B is correct.** US GAAP mirrors an economic reasoning threshold: capitalization begins only when a project’s success becomes reasonably assured. Technological feasibility acts as this gate. Before feasibility, expenditures are exploratory and uncertain; after feasibility, the firm is constructing an asset with expected future utility. Thus, GAAP capitalizes costs incurred after feasibility but before the software is ready for use.

A is incorrect because capitalization does not wait until completion; it begins after feasibility and continues through development.

C is incorrect because preliminary design and feasibility studies occur before technological feasibility is established and must be expensed as incurred.
