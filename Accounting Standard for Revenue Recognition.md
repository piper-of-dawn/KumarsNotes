## Key Pointers

1. **Five step process for Revenue Recognition**
		**Step 1: Identify the Contract**
		Establish a valid agreement exists. *Example: A SaaS company signs a one-year software subscription agreement with a client for $12,000.*
		**Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations**
		Break down what you're actually delivering. *Example: The SaaS contract includes both software access AND monthly support—two separate obligations.*
		**Step 3: Determine Transaction Price**
		Figure out how much you'll actually receive. *Example: The $12,000 total, minus any discounts or variable fees based on usage.*
		**Step 4: Allocate the Price**
		Split the total across each obligation. *Example: Allocate $10,000 to software and $2,000 to support based on their standalone selling prices.*
		**Step 5: Recognize Revenue**
		Record it when you deliver. *Example: Recognize $1,000/month for software and $167/month for support as they're provided, not all $12,000 upfront.*

2. The converged accounting standards issued by the IASB and FASB in May 2014 introduced some changes to the basic principles of revenue recognition. 

3. Under IFRS, probable means more likely than not, and under US GAAP, it means likely to occur. As a result, economically similar contracts may be treated differently under IFRS and US GAAP.

4. **Principal vs. Agent**:
	* **Principal**: Takes inventory risk. Example: Amazon Retail buys goods → books **full selling price** as revenue.
	* **Agent**: No inventory risk. Example: Amazon Marketplace → books **only the commission**.
	* **Core insight**: Agent arrangements shrink reported revenue but usually boost margins because almost no cost of goods sits on the agent.

5. **Franchising / Licensing**	
	* **Company-owned stores**: McDonald’s records **full restaurant sales**.
	* **Franchise model**: McDonald’s collects **~5.5% royalty** on franchisee sales.
	* **Upfront franchise fee**: Recognized **over the contract life** (e.g., spread across 10 years).
	* **Ancillary revenues**: McDonald’s often sells **equipment and supplies** to franchisees.
	* **Core insight**: Corporate stores lift revenue but require heavy capex; franchises shrink revenue but deliver high-margin recurring royalties.

6. **Software: License vs. Service (SaaS)**
	* **Perpetual license**: Microsoft Office sold once → **revenue recognized upfront**.
	* **Support + updates**: Office 365 → **subscription**, recognized **ratably each month**.
	* **Pure service**: Netflix subscription → recognized **as service is delivered**.
	* **Core insight**: One-time licenses create lumpy revenue; SaaS smooths revenue and boosts predictability.

7. **Long-Term Construction / Production Contracts**
	* Example: Boeing. If an aircraft is **60% complete**, Boeing recognizes **60% of total contract revenue**.
	* **Method**: Progress measured by **costs incurred** relative to total expected cost.
	* **Core insight**: Revenue tracks **work performed**, not physical delivery.

8. **Bill-and-Hold Arrangements**
	* Example: Customer buys a car but asks dealer to **hold it for 3 months**.
	* Dealer recognizes revenue **when the car is ready for the customer and control has effectively transferred**, not when physically picked up.
	* **Core insight**: Delivery isn’t the test—**transfer of control** is.
