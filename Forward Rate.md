### Why it is called ´Forward´?
This is the implied interest rate for the future. 1-year forward rate would be the rate that market expects in one year for now, and is implied from the **longer duration bonds**.

## How is this expectation formed?

Let us start with a simple example:
	- 1 year yield is 4%
	- 2 year yield is 6%

If I want to hold a 2 year bond of FV = $1:
	- Deal 1: I can either buy a two year bond or,
	- Deal 2: I can buy one year bond now and re-invest the proceeds into another one year bond once this matures in a year.

Both these transactions are identical and should yield the same, otherwise there would be arbitrage (free money).
 Payoff from Deal 1: $$ (1+0.05)²= 110.25 $$ Payoff from Deal 2:
$$(1+0.04)(1+f_r)$$
Here $f_r$ is forward rate. Solving for $f_r$ by equating payoffs yields a forward rate of $0.06$
