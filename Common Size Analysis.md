# **RATIOS & COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS — NOTES + EXAMPLES (MY STYLE)**

## **1. TLDR (first-principles casual)**

Common-size = “convert cash flows into percentages so you read patterns, not numbers.”
Two anchors: **total inflows/outflows** or **net revenue**. Makes cross-period and cross-company comparison trivial.

---

# **2. CORE FRAMEWORK**

**Purpose:** isolate *structure* of cash generation and usage.
**Input:** Cash flow statement (direct or indirect).
**Output:** Each line as % of (a) total cash flows or (b) revenue.

* **% of inflows/outflows** → How cash is sourced and spent.
* **% of net revenue** → How cash flows scale with sales (forecasting tool).

**Memory hook:**
*“Inflows/outflows = anatomy; revenue = physiology.”*

# **3. METHOD A — % OF TOTAL CASH INFLOWS/OUTFLOWS**

(Acme Corporation, Exhibits 3–4) 

### **Example (Direct Method – Acme)**

Cash received from customers: **USD 23,543**
Total inflows: **USD 24,305**

**Interpretation:**
Cash from customers = **96.9%** of total inflows → Acme is almost entirely customer-funded; minimal asset sales.

**Outflows:**

* Suppliers: USD 11,996 → **49%** of outflows
* Employees: USD 4,113 → **16.8%**
* Operating expenses: USD 3,532 → **14.4%**
* Interest: USD 1,134 → **4.6%**

**Meaning:**
Operating outflows dominate → classic operating-heavy business.
Supplier payments ~half → sensitive to supplier terms and input costs.

**Memory hook:**
*“Half to suppliers. One-sixth to employees. One-seventh to overhead. One-twentieth to interest.”*
(Acme’s pattern; quick recall.)

## **4. METHOD B — INDIRECT METHOD, % OF INFLOWS/OUTFLOWS**

(Acme Panel B) 

### **Example (Indirect Method – Acme)**

Operating cash inflow: **USD 20,696**
Total inflows: **USD 28,368**

**→ 72.8% of cash inflows come from operations.**

Sale of equipment: **USD 7,672** → **27.2% of inflows**

**Outflows:**
Purchase of equipment: **36.9%** of outflows
Retirement of long-term debt: **14.2%**
Retirement of common stock: **7.8%**

**Meaning:**
Acme is reinvesting heavily: equipment purchases are the largest cash drain.

**Memory hook:**
*“Indirect = operations dominate; investing drains.”*

---

# **5. METHOD C — % OF NET REVENUE (FORECASTING METHOD)**

(Acme, Exhibit 5) 

**Why powerful:** If revenue grows 10%, these % tell you what cash items will look like.

### **Example (Net Revenue Approach – Acme)**

Net revenue = **USD 23,543**.

* Cash paid to suppliers = **USD 7,577** → **32.2% of revenue**
* Cash paid to employees = 17.7%
* Cash paid for equipment = **5.5%**
* Net cash provided by operations = **11.8%**

**Interpretation:**
Suppliers consistently absorb ~1/3 of sales → stable cost structure.
Equipment outflow ~5% → moderate capex intensity.
Operating cash ~12% of revenue → decent cash conversion.

**Memory hook:**
*“Rule of thirds: 1/3 to suppliers, 1/3 to everyone else, ~1/10 flows back as cash.”*

# **6. APPLE CASE STUDY — COMMON-SIZE CF AS % OF SALES**

(Exhibit 6, p.3–4) 

Highly exam-relevant. This is exactly the type of interpretation CFA loves.

### **A. Depreciation & amortization % of sales**

* 2015 → 4.9%
* 2016 → 4.4%
* 2017 → 4.4%

**Interpretation:**
Apple is asset-light relative to sales. Depreciation stable → predictable capex requirements.

---

### **B. Capex % of sales**

* Purchases of PPE:

  * 2015 → 6.9%
  * 2016 → 5.6%
  * 2017 → 7.1%

**Meaning:**
Capex > depreciation in all years → Apple is expanding capacity, not merely replacing old assets.

**Memory hook:**
*“Capex > Depreciation = growth mode.”*

---

### **C. Operating cash flow % of sales vs net profit margin**

* Operating CF as % of sales:

  * 2015 → 34.8%
  * 2016 → 39.5%
  * 2017 → 27.7%

* Net profit margin:

  * 22.8% → 21.2% → 21.1%

**Interpretation:**
Operating CF consistently exceeds net profit margin → high earnings quality.
Margin trends: profit margin stable; operating CF margin fluctuates due to working capital changes.

**Memory hook:**
*“Profit margin ~21%. Cash margin ~30–40%. Apple turns earnings into cash exceptionally well.”*

---

### **D. Use of Operating Cash Flow**

PDF highlights clear usage:

* Marketable securities purchases
* PPE investments
* Dividends
* Buybacks

**Meaning:**
Apple generates cash far beyond internal needs → funds shareholder distributions + investments.

**Memory hook:**
*“Apple uses excess cash to buy the world (and its own stock).”*

# **7. WHY THESE EXAMPLES MATTER (FIRST PRINCIPLES)**

1. **Acme** = textbook teaching model.

   * Stable inflow structure
   * Predictable operating payments
   * Classic manufacturing-style CF layout

2. **Apple** = real-world high-cash-conversion giant.

   * Massive cash margin
   * Capex smaller than cash inflow
   * Strong earnings quality

These two extremes teach you:
**Common-size CF is the fastest way to judge a firm’s operating engine, reinvestment burden, and financial discipline.**

---

# **8. ULTRA-SHORT REVISION (2 lines)**

Common-size CF statements express each cash line as % of total inflows/outflows or % of net revenue, making trend detection and forecasting trivial.
Acme teaches stable structure; Apple teaches high cash conversion—together anchoring the concept.
