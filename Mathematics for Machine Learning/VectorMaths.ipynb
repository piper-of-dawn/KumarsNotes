    "If two vectors are orthogonal, then the angle between them is 90 degrees and the cosine of 90 degrees is 0. Therefore, the dot product of two orthogonal vectors is 0. If two vectors are in opposite directions, then the angle between them is 180 degrees and the cosine of 180 degrees is -1. Therefore, the dot product of two vectors in opposite directions is -1. If two vectors are in the same direction, then the angle between them is 0 degrees and the cosine of 0 degrees is 1. Therefore, the dot product of two vectors in the same direction is 1.\n",
