Below is a **dense, clean, exam-oriented explanation** of the full PDF *Presentation and Disclosure* in **your style**—first-principles, zero fluff, memory hooks. All page references cite your uploaded file.

# **TL;DR (First Principles)**

Financial statement presentation = *showing the user **what** assets the firm owns and **how** they are measured*.
Disclosure = *explaining **how** numbers were produced and **why** they changed.*

For long-lived assets, IFRS demands **full transparency**:

* What model? (cost vs revaluation)
* What assumptions? (useful lives, impairment assumptions, cash-generating units)
* What changes? (reconciliation from opening to closing balances)
* What risks? (sensitivity of recoverable values)

Memory hook: **“IFRS = Explain everything; GAAP = Explain basics.”**

---

# **1. IFRS Disclosure Requirements for PPE (Page 1)**

A company must disclose **for each class** of property, plant, and equipment:

* **Measurement basis** used (cost model or revaluation model).
* **Depreciation method** (straight-line, units-of-production, etc.).
* **Useful life or depreciation rate**.
* **Gross carrying amount** and **accumulated depreciation** at the beginning and end of period.
* **Reconciliation** of opening → closing carrying amount.
* **Depreciation expense** for the period.
* **Major classes of PPE**.
* **Restrictions**, pledges, or contractual obligations related to PPE.
* If revalued → **date**, **method**, **assumptions**, **carrying amount under cost model**, and **revaluation surplus**.

Memory hook: **“For PPE: Method, Life, Amounts, Movement, Restrictions.”**

---

# **2. IFRS Disclosure Requirements for Intangibles (Page 1)**

For each class of intangible assets:

* **Finite or indefinite life**.
* If finite → **useful life / amortization method**, gross and accumulated amounts.
* If indefinite → disclose **carrying amount** and **why** the life is treated as indefinite.
* **Restrictions**, pledges, and contractual commitments.
* If revalued → disclose the same level of detail as PPE.

Memory hook: **“Finite = show amortization; Indefinite = justify eternity.”**

---

# **3. Impairment Disclosure Requirements (Page 1)**

### **IFRS**

Must disclose:

* **Amount** of impairment losses and reversals **for each class**.
* **Events** and **circumstances** leading to impairment.
* **Which line item** the impairment hits.
* **Recoverable amount basis**: value in use or fair value less costs to sell.
* **Assumptions** used for recoverable amounts (discount rates, growth rates, CGU allocation).

### **US GAAP**

* Discloses **impairment losses** (no reversal allowed).
* Must describe:

  * The impaired asset
  * Reason for impairment
  * How fair value was assessed
  * Where loss is reported

Memory hook: **“IFRS = Recognize + Reverse + Explain; GAAP = Recognize + Explain.”**

---

# **4. Where Disclosures Appear (Page 1)**

Long-lived asset information shows up across:

* **Balance sheet** (carrying value).
* **Income statement** (depreciation, amortization, impairment).
* **Cash flow statement** (acquisitions/disposals in investing section).
* **Notes** (all assumptions and movement schedules).

Under IFRS: depreciation expense can appear separately or grouped under nature/function of expense.

Key distinction:

* **Nature of expense method** = group costs by type.
* **Function of expense method** = allocate to departments (R&D, COGS, SG&A).

# **5. Example: Orange SA Financial Statement Disclosures (Pages 2–4)**

The remaining three pages show real-world disclosure extracts from Orange SA’s 2017 annual report. These exemplify exactly how IFRS wants information displayed.

---

# **Page 2: Income Statement Extract**

Shows:

* Revenues
* Depreciation and amortization
* Impairment of goodwill
* Impairment of fixed assets
* Operating income

Takeaway: IFRS requires separate line items for **depreciation**, **amortization**, and **impairment**.

---

# **Page 2: Balance Sheet Extract**

Shows carrying amounts for:

* PPE
* Goodwill
* Intangible assets
* Assets held for sale
* Equity and liabilities

Purpose: transparency of non-current asset investment levels.

---

# **Page 2: Goodwill Reconciliation Table (Note 7.2)**

This is classic IFRS:

* Opening balance
* Acquisitions
* Disposals
* Translation adjustments
* Impairment
* Reclassifications
* Closing balance

Memory hook: **“IFRS always shows movement from start → end.”**

---

# **Page 2: Recoverable Value Assumptions (Note 7.3)**

Shows discount rates and perpetual growth rates for CGUs in France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Romania.

This is required because IFRS uses **value in use** (discounted cash flows).

---

# **Page 2: Sensitivity Analysis (Note 7.4)**

Shows how recoverable amounts change if discount rate or growth assumptions shift by ±1%.

Memory hook: **“IFRS: Tell me your DCF inputs AND how fragile they are.”**

---

# **Page 3: Other Intangible Assets (Note 8.3)**

Breakdown of:

* Telecom licenses
* Software
* Orange brand
* Customer bases
* Other intangibles

Each with 3-year comparison (2015–2017).
IFRS requires this by asset class.

---

# **Page 3: PPE (Note 8.4)**

Shows:

* Land and buildings
* Network and terminals
* Other PPE

Again with carrying values for 2015–2017.

Memory hook: **“IFRS wants three numbers: beginning, movement, ending.”**

---

# **Page 3: Disclosure of Impairment Events (Narrative Section)**

Explains country-specific impairment charges (e.g., Poland, Egypt, Congo).
Shows how political, market, FX events feed into impairment.

Purpose: disclosure of **why** impairment happened.

---

# **Page 4: Question/Answer Section**

Illustrates use of disclosed data:

1. Percentage of total assets represented by goodwill & intangibles.
2. Largest impairment loss components.
3. How recoverable amount is estimated (value in use).
4. Effect of changing discount and growth rates.
5. Largest components of intangible assets and PPE.

This section teaches how analysts **use** disclosures to interpret financial health.

---

# **Exam-Ready Revision Sheet (Your Style)**

* **PPE:** disclose method, model, useful life, depreciation, balances, reconciliation, restrictions.
* **Intangibles:** disclose finite/indefinite life, amortization method, amounts, revaluation, restrictions.
* **Impairment:** disclose losses, reversals (IFRS), assumptions, reasons, CGU basis.
* **Recoverable value:** disclose discount rates, growth rates, sensitivity.
* **Goodwill:** reconciliation from opening to closing; impairment testing assumptions.
* **Notes:** breakdown of every major asset category with 3-year comparative values.
* **Cash flow:** show acquisitions/disposals in investing section.
* **Income statement:** separate depreciation, amortization, impairment.
* **IFRS theme:** *complete transparency of methods, assumptions, and changes.*
