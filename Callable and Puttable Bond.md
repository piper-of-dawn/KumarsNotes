## Callable Bond 
1. Buyer has a right to buy a bond back at a specified price.
2. Suppose I sell you a bond for $1000 at t, which I agree to buy back one year later at $1050 at t+1.
	
	1000        1050 
	|-------------|
	t            t+1

#### At t+1
Scenario 1: Price is 1100
I make a profit
Scenario 2: Price is 1000
I won't exercise this option.

## Puttable Bond 
1. Buyer has a right to sell the bond at a specified price.
